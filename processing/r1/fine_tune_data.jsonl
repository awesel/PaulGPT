If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the nature of superlinear returns in various aspects of life, and how do they relate to capitalism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two fundamental causes of superlinear returns?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an example of a situation where superlinear returns can be observed, and what factors influence success in that context?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes successful startups from those that struggle to survive?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for startups to prioritize growth rate over absolute numbers according to Y Combinator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows exponentially."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does YC's approach suggest a relationship between growth rate and founder performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate \"you get out what you put in,\" but it's not far from the truth. And if growth rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people find exponential growth surprising or unnatural?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll get exponential growth.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do humans lack established customs for dealing with exponential growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a historical method for expanding power and influence through territory?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "a way to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn't affect customs very much. The emperor was a remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use in one's own life."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the impact of exponential growth in scholarship on societal customs during preindustrial times?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain topics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the relationship between ideas and territory evolved in recent centuries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But this phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated it. Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances of it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the term \"winner take all\" illustrate about the relationship between performance and returns in competitive scenarios?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression \"winner take all.\" In a sports match the relationship between performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets one win whether they do much better or just slightly better."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors can lead to the emergence of thresholds in outcomes besides competition?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The source of the step function is not competition per se, however. It's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations where you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting a target."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do superlinear returns influence competitive dynamics in markets and conflicts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage, which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the exponential growth and concentration of fame?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because existing fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it's so concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the A-list in the average person's head."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the concept of thresholds in learning contribute to exponential growth in knowledge and the discovery of new fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read, you're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two ways work can compound, and how can learning influence this process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure, or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless."}]}

People in Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure. They'll only continue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. But if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should yield results eventually."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of continuous learning in achieving exponential growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning, you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to explore unconventional or lesser-known topics while learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "you're learning. Don't limit yourself to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable, and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of using thresholds and competition as heuristics in decision-making?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the form \"seek thresholds\" or \"seek competition?\" Here the situation is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette, you'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the best case you're no better off. \"Seek competition\" is similarly useless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of the return curve — because something that grows fast enough will grow big even if it's trivially small at first — but thresholds only guarantee the shape."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What principle can be applied to identify opportunities for creating better products in a competitive market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd buy a better alternative if you made one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can we identify research questions that may lead to entirely new fields of study?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty, but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research problem"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach should researchers take to foster genuine curiosity and potentially make new discoveries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism — to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what you're supposed to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the current trends regarding superlinear returns in various fields of work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting one for the ambitious. And there's good news in this department: this territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types of work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns themselves are growing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors are contributing to the current shifts in organizational dynamics?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two reasons for this, though they're so closely intertwined that they're more like one and a half: progress in technology, and the decreasing importance of organizations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the necessity of being part of an organization for ambitious projects changed over the past fifty years?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of an organization, you weren't likely to achieve much. There were a handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the landscape of opportunities and freedom for individuals changed in recent years compared to the past?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns for performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in my lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists and writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious projects that don't require much initial funding, and lots of new ways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact has recent change had on the returns for performance compared to historical standards?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change has been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering what's at stake. It's hard to imagine a more fundamental change than one in the returns for performance."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who is best suited to pursue superlinear returns in a system with greater outcome variation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more variation in outcomes. Which doesn't imply everyone will be better off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly will do worse. That's an important point to bear in mind. Exposing oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for superlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know they're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to risk trying it to find out."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How will the shift away from traditional institutions impact access to opportunities for new individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The switch away from institutions won't simply be an exodus of their current inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they'd never have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity will be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural version the institutions themselves might have cooked up."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of striving for exceptional work in a competitive environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for performance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because there's less competition at the far end — and not just for the obvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well, but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few even try. Which means it's not just a bargain to do exceptional work, but a bargain even to try to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to achieving exceptional work and standing out in a competitive environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right. For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're interested in, and to find ways to work on it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When is it most advantageous to pursue high-demand, time-consuming work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It will also be important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example, if there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when you're young and don't yet have children."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key elements involved in producing high-quality work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a surprising amount of technique to doing great work. It's not just a matter of trying hard. I'm going to take a shot giving a recipe in one paragraph."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does luck influence success when working independently?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck is always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component of true chance that you can't do anything about. The solution is to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking risks early."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What field is characterized by superlinear returns due to exponential growth and performance thresholds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably science. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined with thresholds at the extreme edge of performance — literally at the limits of knowledge."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the disparity in contributions to scientific discovery throughout history?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery that makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies seem mild by comparison. Newton's discoveries were arguably greater than all his contemporaries' combined."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between superlinear returns and inequality in outcomes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell it out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return curve, the greater the variation in outcomes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics of a field indicate the potential for superlinear returns?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some fields where a small number of individuals achieve significantly higher success than the majority?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else? Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds; you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth. But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to be"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for investors to have unique insights about a company's potential for success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers saying things that other people have already said. But it's just as true in investing, for example. It's only useful to believe that a company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will already reflect that, and there's no room to make money."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of focusing on initial efforts in the growth of startups and learning processes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the startup world, the name for this principle is \"do things that don't scale.\" If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first start learning something, you feel lost. But it's worth making the initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the easier it will get."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of work evolved beyond traditional employment in creative and academic fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the 20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a result we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with having a job. Even now to most people the phrase \"your work\" means their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever they're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it's part of their portfolio."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between curiosity and success in fields with high potential returns?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately, but you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one. Your curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns if they're not already part of one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do ambition and curiosity play in achieving superlinear returns?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed, the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges arise in defining the concepts of effort, performance, and return in various contexts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort, performance, and return, because they're not sharply distinguished in fact. What counts as return to one person might be performance to another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry, they're not meaningless. I've tried to write about them as precisely as I could without crossing into error."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does evolution illustrate the concept of superlinear returns in performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Evolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of superlinear returns for performance. But this is hard for us to empathize with because we're not the recipients; we're the returns."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did knowledge and technique contribute to human life before the Industrial Revolution?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Knowledge did of course have a practical effect before the Industrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human life completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad, gradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few exceptionally learned people."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does a step function represent the reward curve for effort in rational decision-making?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not mathematically correct to describe a step function as superlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a superlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort by a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the step is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after the step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one would bother."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential benefits and limitations of seeking competition when identifying promising problems to work on?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Seeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that some people find it motivating. It's also somewhat of a guide to promising problems, because it's a sign that other people find them promising. But it's a very imperfect sign: often there's a clamoring crowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by someone quietly working on another one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors can contribute to the popularity of mediocre products or services?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When something is popular despite being mediocre, there's often a hidden reason why. Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete. Perhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for deciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things that exist for such reasons."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated you to study painting at art school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "and even went to art school to study painting.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors prevent individuals from achieving the maximum potential of their learning experiences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In principle everyone is getting superlinear returns.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential implications of differing interpretations of \"equity\" among its advocates on institutional power and overall societal outcomes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's unclear exactly what advocates of \"equity\" mean by it. They seem to disagree among themselves. But whatever they mean is probably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power to control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than everyone else."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the emergence of this concept during a time of increasing performance variation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just the moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction, but I don't think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it arose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly increasing variation in performance."}]}

But it's not simply that they don't want anyone to have what they can't. The conventional-minded literally can't imagine what it's like to have novel ideas. So the whole phenomenon of great variation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they encounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some malign external influence."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the best approach to determine what projects or areas to focus on when unsure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to focus on personal projects in your work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let \"work\" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your part of it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria should you consider when choosing projects throughout different stages of life?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach yourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does curiosity play in driving and guiding great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you do after discovering a deep interest in a subject to advance your understanding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of questioning assumptions in making new discoveries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is strangeness considered a valuable quality in great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math. It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears, embrace it."}]}

If you're excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking, that's as good a bet as you'll find."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the process for making significant contributions in any field?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to work on something you are deeply interested in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality. That's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the three most powerful motives that can drive human behavior?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do individuals face when deciding on a career path?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late based on very incomplete information."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the dual nature of ambition impact decision-making in pursuing great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do educational systems often misrepresent the ease of committing to a career path?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage."}]}

They don't tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does."}]}

You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you prioritize when exploring new fields of study?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When in doubt, optimize for interestingness.

The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive. And you're more likely to find new things if you're looking where few have looked before."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you consider when choosing between multiple projects or fields of work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty. If in the course of working on one thing you discover another that's more exciting, don't be afraid to switch."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the best approach to ensure that your creation resonates with an audience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're making something for people, make sure it's something they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key principle to consider when writing a story that will resonate with readers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong. Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you're lost."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you prioritize when deciding what projects to pursue?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does pursuing your interests require beyond mere enthusiasm?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it does take a good deal of boldness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the recommended approach for achieving great work according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of planning when it comes to achieving unexpected discoveries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can't discover natural selection that way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach do successful individuals often take to achieve great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach \"staying upwind.\" This is how most people who've done great work seem to have done it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges might one face when pursuing a new and exciting project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even when you've found something exciting to work on, working on it is not always straightforward.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential consequences of working excessively hard?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, while you must work hard, it's possible to work too hard, and if you do that you'll find you get diminishing returns: fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health. The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for four or five hours a day."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to have contiguous blocks of time for focused work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try to arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in. You'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies can help overcome the initial resistance to starting a task?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the sense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy can help overcome reluctance to start work in the morning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn't. When I'm reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by saying \"I'll just read over what I've got so far.\" Five minutes later I've found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and I'm off."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset can be beneficial when initiating new projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It's ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example. Lots of great things began with someone saying \"How hard could it be?\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantages do young people have in situations requiring optimism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is one case where the young have an advantage. They're more optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to complete projects even when they require more effort than anticipated?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the potential benefit of exaggerating the importance of your work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what you're working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the different forms of procrastination, and which one is considered more dangerous?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't quite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What makes per-project procrastination particularly deceptive compared to per-day procrastination?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around doing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So per-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You're too busy to notice it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one ensure they are focusing on their true passions as they age?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on? When you're young it's ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset is necessary to appreciate the time investment required for great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key to achieving great work according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you're surprised how far you've come."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does consistency contribute to achieving significant goals over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some examples of activities that lead to exponential growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more. Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they'll bring you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often underestimate the impact of exponential growth in its early stages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often underestimate the value of investing in exponential growth during the initial phase?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can undirected thinking contribute to problem-solving?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Work doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can daydreaming enhance creativity and problem-solving in the context of focused work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this phenomenon, though. You can't just walk around daydreaming. The daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds it questions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to manage distractions both at work and during personal time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it's also important to avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out of the top spot, or you'll waste this valuable type of thinking on the distraction instead. (Exception: Don't avoid love.)"}]}

This observation has been made by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth thinking about why it's true. It could be because ambition is a phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short. Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively different thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is simply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can striving to be the best lead to unexpected benefits and simplifications in one's efforts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fortunately there's a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might seem like you'd be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the best, in practice you often end up net ahead. It's exciting, and also strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it's easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a strategy for creating lasting impact in your work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter more than your contemporaries', but because something that still seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the concept of affectation in relation to personal authenticity in work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is doing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while you're pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows in the work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can young people overcome feelings of insignificance and build their identity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They often feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that problem, because it's self-solving if you work on sufficiently ambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you're not a nobody; you're the person who did it. So just do the work and your identity will take care of itself."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a positive way to express the idea of avoiding affectation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Avoid affectation\" is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how would you express this idea positively? How would you say what to be, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you're earnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar vices."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of intellectual honesty in the pursuit of new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We're taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind of sacrifice. But in fact it's a source of power too. To see new ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You're trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can you have a sharp eye for the truth if you're intellectually dishonest?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can admitting mistakes contribute to intellectual honesty?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing to admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken about something, you're free. Till then you have to carry it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does informality play in expressing earnestness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality. Informality is much more important than its grammatically negative name implies. It's not merely the absence of something. It means focusing on what matters instead of what doesn't."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do formality and affectation impact the quality of work compared to the approach taken by \"nerds\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way as you're doing it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being good. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work: they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that's basically the definition of a nerd."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset or attitude is essential for achieving great work, according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need in doing great work. It's not learned; it's preserved from childhood. So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms of them. \"It's easy to criticize\" is true in the most literal sense, and the route to great work is never easy."}]}

Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I doubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest. It's so hard to do even if you are. You don't have enough margin for error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected, intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one determine the best decision while working on a project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself. It's usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset shift can help overcome resistance to making necessary changes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won't necessarily have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some effort; when there's something you need to redo, status quo bias and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat this ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert to what I have now?"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between mathematical elegance and artistic elegance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from the arts. That's what I thought when I first heard the term \"elegant\" applied to a proof. But now I suspect it's conceptually prior — that the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical elegance. At any rate it's a useful standard well beyond math."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might complicated solutions be more valued in the short term compared to elegant ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will often have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of effort and they're hard to understand, both of which impress people, at least temporarily."}]}

It didn't have to be built, just seen. It's a very good sign when it's hard to say whether you're creating something or discovering it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset should you adopt when engaging in work that involves both creation and discovery?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you're doing work that could be seen as either creation or discovery, err on the side of discovery.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What terms are commonly used in English to describe the ability to generate original and creative ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity, and imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name, because it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It's possible to have a great deal of ability in other respects — to have a great deal of what's often called"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the concept of the creative process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've never liked the term \"creative process.\" It seems misleading. Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle grinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What can be the impact of a lack of expertise on the originality of ideas in unfamiliar fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If the thing they're focused on is something they don't understand very well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most original thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got divorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15 year old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see originality separated from expertise like that made its nature all the more clear."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one increase the likelihood of generating original ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there are definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For example, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're working on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of expressing your thoughts through talking or writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good way to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you. Indeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can changing your environment influence your creativity and idea generation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you'll often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit. Sometimes it's enough just to go for a walk."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can exploring diverse topics enhance creativity and idea generation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It also helps to travel in topic space. You'll have more new ideas if you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives the angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because analogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do curiosity and originality influence each other in the creative process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds originality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship is closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality; it's roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since questions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity at its best is a creative force."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the nature of the process involved in generating new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Having new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of seeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a new idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it difficult to generate new ideas despite them seeming obvious once recognized?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having new ideas is hard. What's the source of this apparent contradiction? It's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world. We see the world through models that both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard. That's how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover: they're easy to see after you do something hard."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one identify flawed models of understanding in their worldview?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other people. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where they bash against reality. Most people don't want to see these clues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached to their current model; it's what they think in; so they'll tend to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous it may seem in retrospect."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach did Einstein take to discover new ideas in physics?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead of looking away. That's what Einstein did. He was able to see the wild implications of Maxwell's equations not so much because he was looking for new ideas as because he was stricter."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to be willing to break rules when trying to develop a new model of the world?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps to be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the point of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially shares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do successful new ideas often appear more conservative in hindsight?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new ideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem perfectly reasonable once you're using the new model of the world they brought with them. But they didn't at the time; it took the greater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally accepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics differentiate a promising new idea from one that is simply bad?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to most people, or someone would have already explored it. So what you're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of crazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty. Often ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of crazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications; whereas ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two types of independence described in relation to breaking rules?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy breaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases being aggressively and passively independent-minded."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates aggressively independent-minded individuals to pursue audacious projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules don't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it started."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can a lack of awareness of established norms contribute to innovation and new discoveries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions acts as a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs. Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does popular culture misunderstand the relationship between strictness and rule-breaking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination. In popular culture they're opposed. But popular culture has a broken model in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial ones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can overcoming subconscious filters lead to the discovery of innovative ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An overlooked idea often doesn't lose till the semifinals. You do see it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious shoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much work, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if you could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a strategy for uncovering valuable ideas that may be hidden due to prevailing misconceptions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other direction: by starting from what's obscuring them. Every cherished but mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable ideas that are unexplored because they contradict it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What value can be found in the overlooked ideas of religions, according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So anything that can be described either literally or metaphorically as a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow. Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What assumptions in your field might hinder progress if challenged or let go?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being too attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident as they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do individuals often lack originality in choosing the problems they focus on?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who'd never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might individuals be more cautious in selecting problems to tackle compared to solutions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than solutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But even so I think most people are too conservative. They're not merely responding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems are undervalued."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you consider when pursuing research in a field that seems fully explored?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the problem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn't. Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its latent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you're interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of focusing on unfashionable problems in work or research?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There's no hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied elsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And there's a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that would otherwise be wasted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one identify overlooked problems that are often deemed less significant?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly unfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn't seem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these? By being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way, and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head that says you should only be working on \"important\" problems."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you consider when looking for important problems to work on?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is too conservative about what counts as one. And if there's an important but overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it's probably already on your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you were going to take a break from \"serious\" work to work on something just because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The answer is probably more important than it seems."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the choice of problems to work on considered crucial for innovation and discovery?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than originality in solving them. That's what distinguishes the people who discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key to the whole game."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common misconception about the nature of big ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas is about the ratio of question to answer in their composition. People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was in the question."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are questions often undervalued in educational settings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used in schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being answered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery. How do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to earth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By even asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel territory."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential benefits of holding onto unanswered questions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around with you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of noticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing that two unanswered questions are the same."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to revisit questions from our childhood?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before — in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking about. People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful questions alive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between expertise and uncertainty according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from the popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are certain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long as (a) the things you're puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else understands them either."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does puzzlement play in the process of discovering new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Think about what's happening at the moment just before a new idea is discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled about something. Which means that originality consists partly of puzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with the world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do unanswered questions contribute to the pursuit of knowledge?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is one of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones. Questions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the process of answering questions lead to deeper insights?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it just gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict that. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to predict how much will unravel if you pull on it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it beneficial to explore multiple small ideas or projects rather than focusing solely on one?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start lots of small things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to embrace a wide range of experiences and ideas in the creative process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try, the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand, though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things that don't work. You can't have a lot of good ideas without also having a lot of bad ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach can enhance learning and enjoyment when tackling new projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything that's been done before, you'll learn faster and have more fun by trying stuff. And you'll understand previous work better when you do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like two puzzle pieces."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the process for achieving greatness in a project or idea?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it, and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could have planned."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to create successive versions of a product when designing for an audience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're making something for people — to get an initial version in front of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential pitfalls of including excessive new features in a software release?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There are names for doing this with the first version (taking too long to ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these are both merely instances of a more general principle."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it indicate when an early version of a new project is referred to as a \"toy\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a toy. It's a good sign when people do this. That means it has everything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of planning versus starting small and evolving a project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it is to plan in advance what you're going to do. And planning does usually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized to say \"we're going to do x and then y and then z\" than \"we're going to try x and see what happens.\" And it is more"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the drawbacks of planning in project management, and how can flexibility reduce the need for it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Planning per se isn't good. It's sometimes necessary, but it's a necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something you have to do because you're working with inflexible media, or because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between risk and reward in an efficient market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk is proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a bet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally, you're probably being too conservative."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do young people often adopt conservative views despite being in a position to take more risks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it's the young who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear risk, but it's when you're young that you can afford the most."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What benefits can come from working on a challenging project, even if it doesn't succeed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working on it, you'll have crossed territory few others have seen, and encountered questions few others have asked. And there's probably no better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying to do something slightly too hard."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key advantages of youth and age, and how can one leverage them throughout life?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy, time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge, efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of the latter when young and keep some of the former when old."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantages do young people have that they may not fully appreciate?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they have. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest is probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time. The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly frivolous ways: to learn about something you don't need to know about, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinction does the author make between spending time on uncertain pursuits versus clearly wasteful activities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That \"slightly\" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly when you're young, but don't simply waste it. There's a big difference between doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing something you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet, and possibly a better one than you think."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unique perspective does inexperience provide when encountering new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience, is that you're seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain embraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don't fit together perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but occasionally it's with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly and jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the idea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not to."}]}

You'll be tempted to ignore them, since there's a 99% chance the problem is with you. And you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep progressing. But don't forget about them. When you've gotten further into the subject, come back and check if they're still there.

The other half is what you do know that ain't so. You arrive at adulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you've acquired and false things you've been taught — and you won't be able to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in the way of whatever type of work you want to do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do schools influence our perceptions of learning and thinking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools. We're so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school as identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of strange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do traditional school structures affect student engagement and learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child, there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you what you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither classes nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they're just artifacts of the way schools are usually designed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can students take more ownership of their education to enhance their learning experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you're still in school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your teachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem a stretch, but it's not merely some weird thought experiment. It's the truth economically, and in the best case it's the truth intellectually as well. The best teachers don't want to be your bosses. They'd prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source of advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the challenges faced in school differ from those encountered in real-world work environments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like. In school they tell you what the problems are, and they're almost always soluble using no more than you've been taught so far. In real life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you often don't know if they're soluble at all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a fundamental flaw in the way schools prepare students for success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win by hacking the test. You can't do great work by doing that. You can't trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way to beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others have overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should one keep in mind when facing rejection from admissions or prize committees?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And don't take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that impress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different from those required to do great work. The decisions of selection committees are only meaningful to the extent that they're part of a feedback loop, and very few are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does copying existing work play in the learning process for newcomers in a field?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing inherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how something works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does copying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes productive copying from detrimental copying in creative work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a good way to copy and a bad way. If you're going to copy something, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still, unconsciously. This is what's meant by the famously misattributed phrase \"Great artists steal.\" The really dangerous kind of copying, the kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that's done without realizing it, because you're nothing more than a train running on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other extreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it common for early work in many fields to be influenced by the work of others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In many fields it's almost inevitable that your early work will be in some sense based on other people's. Projects rarely arise in a vacuum. They're usually a reaction to previous work. When you're first starting out, you don't have any previous work; if you're going to react to something, it has to be someone else's. Once you're established, you can react to your own. But while the former gets called derivative and the latter doesn't, structurally the two cases are more similar than they seem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the perception of novelty in new ideas lead to misconceptions about their originality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes makes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New discoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of existing things,"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential risks of relying on copying as a method of learning or innovation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are definitely some dangers to copying, though.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What misconception might inexperienced individuals have about the relationship between talent and behavior?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are jerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that being a jerk is part of being talented. It isn't; being talented is merely how they get away with it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can exploring ideas from different fields enhance creativity and innovation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries of this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can negative examples contribute to valuable learning experiences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you can sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things done well; sometimes it only becomes clear what's needed when it's missing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it beneficial to spend time in environments with highly accomplished individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one place, it's usually a good idea to visit for a while. It will increase your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people are human, increase your self-confidence."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can showing genuine interest influence your interactions with experts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're earnest you'll probably get a warmer welcome than you might expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy to talk about it with anyone who's genuinely interested. If they're really good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist's interest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their hobbies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the perception of research quality differ among various departments in universities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It may take some effort to find the people who are really good, though. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places, particularly universities, there's a polite fiction that everyone is engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities can't say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in different departments varies immensely. Some departments have people doing great work; others have in the past; others never have."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to collaborate with colleagues, even on individual projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't be done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is having a few exceptional colleagues more beneficial than having many average ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good ones. In fact it's not merely better, but necessary, judging from history: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests that one's colleagues often make the difference between doing great work and not."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics indicate that you have sufficiently good colleagues?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you're unsure, you probably don't. But it may be possible to give a more concrete answer than that.

If you want to run a project like that, you'll have to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude and interest like any other kind of work. If you don't have them, there is no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn management as a second language, or avoid such projects."}]}

It's the basis of everything when you're working on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a living organism."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does one's perspective on life affect their work performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Morale starts with your view of life. You're more likely to do great work if you're an optimist, and more likely to if you think of yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can engaging in meaningful work help individuals cope with personal challenges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If you choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a refuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism, it's a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by some of the greatest minds in history."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the relationship between morale and work performance influence productivity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which increases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this cycle also operates in the other direction: if you're not doing good work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since it matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when you're stuck, just so you start to get something done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can ambitious individuals maintain their morale in the face of setbacks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting. You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always involves some backtracking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of persistence and adaptability in achieving success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to. So \"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again\" isn't quite right. It should be: If at first you don't succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try again."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a more nuanced approach to handling setbacks without giving up?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Never give up\" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times when it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one differentiate between productive struggle and harmful pain in their work or activities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more than it's a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends how fast you're running. So learn to distinguish good pain from bad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How important is the size of an audience for sustaining morale in creative fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An audience is a critical component of morale. If you're a scholar, your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience in the traditional sense. Either way it doesn't need to be big. The value of an audience doesn't grow anything like linearly with its size. Which is bad news if you're famous, but good news if you're just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people genuinely love what you're doing, that's enough."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can avoiding intermediaries impact your connection with your audience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between you and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable, but it's so liberating to escape it that you might be better off switching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the company you keep impact your overall morale and energy levels?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your morale. You'll find there are some who increase your energy and others who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always what you'd expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and avoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there's someone you need to take care of, that takes precedence."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to choose a partner who supports your ambition and work commitment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work, or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're ambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition; so someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you, or does and doesn't care."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some key practices to maintain good morale?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it's important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of drugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise because they're good for thinking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between doing great work and personal happiness, particularly for smart and ambitious individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone else, but they're happier than they'd be if they didn't. In fact, if you're smart and ambitious, it's dangerous"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How should one prioritize whose opinions to value when seeking to impress others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people. The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just adds noise."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a more important factor to consider about a type of work than its prestige?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and sometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of work is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can competition influence your approach to problem-solving?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose the problem for you; don't let yourself get drawn into chasing something just because others are. In fact, don't let competitors make you do anything much more specific than work harder."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What single trait is suggested as essential for achieving great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Notice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single word, my bet would be on \"curiosity.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one foster curiosity in their life?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That doesn't translate directly to advice. It's not enough just to be curious, and you can't command curiosity anyway. But you can nurture it and let it drive you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does curiosity play a role in achieving great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the length of this essay suggest about the reader's commitment to doing great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could. But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it this far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so you're already further along than you might realize, because the set of people willing to want to is small."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What two key factors should you focus on to achieve great work, aside from luck and effort?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal, mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and luck. Luck by definition you can't do anything about, so we can ignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to do great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest. Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key to discovering the type of work that suits you best?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different ways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered. Out of all those different types of work, the one you're most suited for is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close match. It's just a question of finding it, and how far into it your ability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by trying."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological factors prevent individuals from pursuing their potential for greatness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds them back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous to try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if you tried something like that, you'd fail. Presumably the calculation is rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do great work. But that's what's going on subconsciously; they shy away from the question."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What choice must you make to achieve great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So I'm going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great work, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that. I wouldn't have done it to a general audience. But we already know you're interested."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you keep in mind when facing the fear of failure in a personal endeavor?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't worry about being presumptuous. You don't have to tell anyone. And if it's too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have worse problems than that. In fact you'll be lucky if it's the worst problem you have."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What attitude can help make hard work feel less burdensome?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you'll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to work hard. And if you're working on something you find very interesting, which you necessarily will if you're on the right path, the work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your peers'."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on defining and recognizing great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't think you could give a precise definition of what counts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. But there's no threshold for importance. It's a matter of degree, and often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I'd rather people focused on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether they're important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and leave it to future generations to say if you succeeded."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do everyday observations play in the creation of standup comedy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in everyday life. \"Did you ever notice...?\" New ideas come from doing this about nontrivial things. Which may help explain why people's reaction to a new idea is often the first half of laughing: Ha!"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes genuine enthusiasm for an unconventional idea from being viewed as a crank?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That second qualifier is critical. If you're excited about something most authorities discount, but you can't give a more precise explanation than \"they don't get it,\" then you're starting to drift into the territory of cranks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges might one face when trying to identify a meaningful project or problem to work on?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding a match between the current version of you and a list of known problems. You'll often have to coevolve with the problem. That's why it can sometimes be so hard to figure out what to work on. The search space is huge. It's the cartesian product of all possible types of work, both known and yet to be discovered, and all possible future versions of you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do researchers face when searching through large datasets, and how do they cope with these challenges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's no way you could search this whole space, so you have to rely on heuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope the best matches will be clustered. Which they will not always be; different types of work have been collected together as much by accidents of history as by the intrinsic similarities between them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are curious people more likely to excel in their work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do great work, but one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide net, they're more likely to find the right thing to work on in the first place."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential risks of creating content for an audience perceived as less sophisticated?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you feel is less sophisticated than you, if that causes you to talk down to them. You can make a lot of money doing that, if you do it in a sufficiently cynical way, but it's not the route to great work. Not that anyone using this m.o. would care."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does our perception of short-term versus long-term procrastination affect our productivity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Just as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done by procrastinating for a day and underestimate the damage done by procrastinating for several years."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the challenges of pursuing a career aligned with your passions while also needing to earn a living?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can't usually get paid for doing exactly what you want, especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side. Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your work is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight to get time to do it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the environment you create for work influence your ability to focus and relax?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax cycle automatically.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria should beliefs meet to be considered safe and unquestionable?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable if and only if they're also unfalsifiable. For example, it's safe to have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under the law, because a sentence with a \"should\" in it isn't really a statement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And if there's no evidence that could disprove one of your principles, there can't be any facts you'd need to ignore in order to preserve it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between affectation and intellectual dishonesty in terms of their persistence and nature?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty. Affectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in time, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw."}]}

You couldn't allocate your attention so precisely, of course, but this at least gives an idea of a reasonable distribution."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What implications arise if the principles defining a religion are universally applicable?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The principles defining a religion have to be mistaken. Otherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to distinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the relationship between originality and certainty affect the outcomes of disputes between conventional-minded and independent-minded individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The connection between originality and uncertainty causes a strange phenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain than the independent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand in disputes, even though they're generally stupider."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it imply when a project is dismissed as a \"toy\" in terms of the validity of criticism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Attacking a project as a \"toy\" is similar to attacking a statement as \"inappropriate.\" It means that no more substantial criticism can be made to stick."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can you determine if an activity is a productive use of your time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to tell whether you're wasting time is to ask if you're producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely to be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where you create something is less likely to be a waste of time than playing games where you don't."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does having publicly stated opinions influence one's ability to remain unbiased in evaluating new evidence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another related advantage is that if you haven't said anything publicly yet, you won't be biased toward evidence that supports your earlier conclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve eternal youth in this respect, but few manage to. For most people, having previously published opinions has an effect similar to ideology, just in quantity 1."}]}

From a distance its edges look smooth, but when you learn enough to get close to one, you'll notice it's full of gaps. These gaps will seem obvious; it will seem inexplicable that no one has tried x or wondered about y. In the best case, exploring such gaps yields whole new fractal buds."}]}

If you don't need to go too deeply into a problem, you can solve it without writing. If you're thinking about how two pieces of machinery should fit together, writing about it probably won't help much. And when a problem can be described formally, you can sometimes solve it in your head. But if you need to solve a complicated, ill-defined problem, it will almost always help to write about it. Which in turn means that someone who's not good at writing will almost always be at a disadvantage in solving such problems."}]}

At the time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. At that age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with the authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be some way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn't responsible for my actions. I gradually lost hope of that, but the puzzle remained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter with the feeling that you're free to choose what you do?"}]}

The wrong version is: You can do what you want, but you can't want what you want. Yes, you can control what you do, but you'll do what you want, and you can't control that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can people's desires and preferences change over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason this is mistaken is that people do sometimes change what they want. People who don't want to want something — drug addicts, for example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it. And people who want to want something — who want to like classical music, or broccoli — sometimes succeed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How difficult is it for individuals to change their desires or preferences over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's still not quite true. It's possible to change what you want to want. I can imagine someone saying \"I decided to stop wanting to like classical music.\" But we're getting closer to the truth. It's rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more \"want to\"s we add, the rarer it gets."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can we approach expressing our desires more accurately?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more \"want to\"s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by adding more 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point. In practice three or four \"want to\"s must surely be enough. It's hard even to envision what it would mean to change what you want to want to want to want, let alone actually do it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a way to articulate the complexity of human desires and control over them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So one way to express the correct answer is to use a regular expression. You can do what you want, but there's some statement of the form \"you can't (want to)* want what you want\" that's true. Ultimately you get back to a want that you don't control."}]}

The truths of mathematics would be the same, because they're true by definition. Ditto for the truths of physics; the mass of a carbon atom would be the same on their planet.

It seems fairly likely, too, that it would be true for aliens that one can get better at something by practicing. We'd probably share Occam's razor. There doesn't seem anything specifically human about any of these ideas."}]}

We can't say for sure what forms intelligent life might take. Nor is it my goal here to explore that question, interesting though it is. The point of the idea of alien truth is not that it gives us a way to speculate about what forms intelligent life might take, but that it gives us a threshold, or more precisely a target, for truth. If you're trying to find the most general truths short of those of math or physics, then presumably they'll be those we'd share in common with other forms of intelligent life."}]}

He used to describe a particularly good proof as being in God's book, the implication being (a) that a sufficiently good proof was more discovered than invented, and (b) that its goodness would be universally recognized. If there's such a thing as alien truth, then there's more in God's book than math."}]}

But I didn't know it when we started YC. I only had a few data points: our own startup, and those started by friends. It was a surprise to me how often the same problems recur in different forms. Many later stage investors might never realize this, because later stage investors might not advise 100 startups in their whole career, but a YC partner will get this much experience in the first year or two."}]}

You get a lot of data. Not just because you're looking at more companies, but also because more goes wrong."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is personalized advice important for startups, despite having knowledge of common challenges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But knowing (nearly) all the problems startups can encounter doesn't mean that advising them can be automated, or reduced to a formula. There's no substitute for individual office hours with a YC partner. Each startup is unique, which means they have to be advised by specific partners who know them well."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did Y Combinator face when increasing the size of their startup batches in 2012?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We learned that the hard way, in the notorious \"batch that broke YC\" in the summer of 2012. Up till that point we treated the partners as a pool. When a startup requested office hours, they got the next available slot posted by any partner. That meant every partner had to know every startup. This worked fine up to 60 startups, but when the batch grew to 80, everything broke. The founders probably didn't realize anything was wrong, but the partners were confused and unhappy because halfway through the batch they still didn't know all the companies yet."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach did we take to improve the advising process for startups after encountering difficulties with a particular batch?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The solution we adopted was the classic one in these situations. We sharded the batch into smaller groups of startups, each overseen by a dedicated group of partners. That fixed the problem, and has worked fine ever since. But the batch that broke YC was a powerful demonstration of how individualized the process of advising startups has to be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common issues do startups face during mentorship sessions, and how can mentors help prioritize these problems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They'll come in to talk about three problems they're worrying about. One is of moderate importance, one doesn't matter at all, and one will kill the company if it isn't addressed immediately. It's like watching one of those horror movies where the heroine is deeply upset that her boyfriend cheated on her, and only mildly curious about the door that's mysteriously ajar. You want to say: never mind about your boyfriend, think about that door! Fortunately in office hours you can. So while startups still die with some regularity, it's rarely because they wandered into a room containing a murderer. The YC partners can warn them where the murderers are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do many startup founders fail to heed advice from mentors or advisors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not that founders listen. That was another big surprise: how often founders don't listen to us.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the counterintuitive nature of startups beneficial for Y Combinator's approach to advising founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they're so different from most people's other experiences. No one knows what it's like except those who've done it. Which is why YC partners should usually have been founders themselves. But strangely enough, the counterintuitiveness of startups turns out to be another of the things that make YC work. If it weren't counterintuitive, founders wouldn't need our advice about how to do it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is focus crucial for early stage startups, and how does Y Combinator help them prioritize their challenges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Focus is doubly important for early stage startups, because not only do they have a hundred different problems, they don't have anyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders focus on things that don't matter, there's no one focusing on the things that do. So the essence of what happens at YC is to figure out which problems matter most, then cook up ideas for solving them — ideally at a resolution of a week or less — and then try those ideas and measure how well they worked. The focus is on action, with measurable, near-term results."}]}

If you correct course at a high enough frequency, you can be simultaneously decisive at a micro scale and tentative at a macro scale. The result is a somewhat winding path, but executed very rapidly, like the path a running back takes downfield. And in practice there's less backtracking than you might expect. Founders usually guess right about which direction to run in, especially if they have someone experienced like a YC partner to bounce their hypotheses off. And when they guess wrong, they notice fast, because they'll talk about the results at office hours the next week."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does improving navigational ability contribute to the speed of startup growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A small improvement in navigational ability can make you a lot faster, because it has a double effect: the path is shorter, and you can travel faster along it when you're more certain it's the right one. That's where a lot of YC's value lies, in helping founders get an extra increment of focus that lets them move faster. And since moving fast is the essence of a startup, YC in effect makes startups more startup-like."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the uncertainty founders experience in startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why are founders uncertain about what to do? Partly because startups almost by definition are doing something new, which means no one knows how to do it yet, or in most cases even what \"it\" is.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between the knowledge of YC partners and founders, and how does it benefit experienced founders participating in Y Combinator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "YC is not simply more experienced founders passing on their knowledge. It's more like specialization than apprenticeship. The knowledge of the YC partners and the founders have different shapes: It wouldn't be worthwhile for a founder to acquire the encyclopedic knowledge of startup problems that a YC partner has, just as it wouldn't be worthwhile for a YC partner to acquire the depth of domain knowledge that a founder has. That's why it can still be valuable for an experienced founder to do YC, just as it can still be valuable for an experienced athlete to have a coach."}]}

Before YC, to the extent people thought about the question at all, most assumed they couldn't be combined — that loneliness was the price of independence. That was how it felt to us when we started our own startup in Boston in the 1990s. We had a handful of older people we could go to for advice (of varying quality), but no peers. There was no one we could commiserate with about the misbehavior of investors, or speculate with about the future of technology. I often tell founders to make something they themselves want, and YC is certainly that: it was designed to be exactly what we wanted when we were starting a startup."}]}

That has become a commodity now, at least in the US. But great colleagues can never become a commodity, because the fact that they cluster in some places means they're proportionally absent from the rest."}]}

They also help one another. That's the happiest thing I've learned about startup founders: how generous they can be in helping one another. We noticed this in the first batch and consciously designed YC to magnify it. The result is something far more intense than, say, a university. Between the partners, the alumni, and their batchmates, founders are surrounded by people who want to help them, and can."}]}

Instead of everyone doing the same thing, they're each talking to YC partners to figure out what their specific startup needs."}]}

They do not, having said this, go on to consider whether the statement is true or not. Using such labels is the conversational equivalent of signalling an exception. That's one of the reasons they're used: to end a discussion."}]}

Can a statement be x-ist, for whatever value of x, and also true? If the answer is yes, then they're admitting to banning the truth. That's obvious enough that I'd guess most would answer no. But if they answer no, it's easy to show that they're mistaken, and that in practice such labels are applied to statements regardless of their truth or falsity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the perception of truth vary based on the speaker's identity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement is considered x-ist often depends on who said it.

You could have led a life of exemplary goodness, but if you publicly doubted, say, the divinity of Christ, you were going to burn. Nowadays, in civilized countries, heretics only get fired in the metaphorical sense, by losing their jobs. But the structure of the situation is the same: the heresy outweighs everything else.

No matter how virtuously you've lived, if you commit a crime, you must still suffer the penalty of the law. Having lived a previously blameless life might mitigate the punishment, but it doesn't affect whether you're guilty or not."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between societal reactions to heresy and actual crimes, according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A heresy is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crime — one that makes some people feel not merely that you're mistaken, but that you should be punished. Indeed, their desire to see you punished is often stronger than it would be if you'd committed an actual crime.

It had a very strong component of moral purity, and the aggressively conventional-minded seized upon it with their usual eagerness — all the more because the relaxation of social norms in the preceding decades meant there had been less and less to forbid.

There may exist people whose thoughts are so perfectly formed that they just flow straight into words.

Indeed, this is a trope in movies: the guy who claims to have a plan for doing some difficult thing, and who when questioned further, taps his head and says \"It's all up here.\" Everyone watching the movie knows what that means.

I've written about at least two subjects I know well — Lisp hacking and startups — and in both cases I learned a lot from writing about them.

You can also do it the old way, by talking. But in my experience, writing is the stricter test. You have to commit to a single, optimal sequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don't have tone of voice to carry meaning. And you can focus in a way that would seem excessive in conversation. I'll often spend 2 weeks on an essay and reread drafts 50 times. If you did that in conversation it would seem evidence of some kind of mental disorder. If you're lazy, of course, writing and talking are equally useless. But if you want to push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill."}]}

There's a narrow sense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader one in which it refers to preferences of any kind. The strongest proof would be to show that taste exists in the narrowest sense, so I'm going to talk about taste in art. You have better taste than me if the art you like is better than the art I like."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one determine who has better taste in art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ".

And that means you have to discard the possibility of people being good at making it. Which means there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What led the author to understand the value of skill and good taste in art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That was how I realized my father was wrong. I started studying painting. And it was just like other kinds of work I'd done: you could do it well, or badly, and if you tried hard, you could get better at it. And it was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini were much better at it than me. That gap between us was not imaginary. They were so good. And if they could be good, then art could be good, and there was such a thing as good taste after all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the perception that good taste in art is subjective and often disputed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now that I've explained how to show there is such a thing as good taste, I should also explain why people think there isn't. There are two reasons. One is that there's always so much disagreement about taste. Most people's response to art is a tangle of unexamined impulses. Is the artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this the sort of art they're supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famous museum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice most people's response to art is dominated by such extraneous factors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the nature of artistic taste and its evolution over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And the people who do claim to have good taste are so often mistaken. The paintings admired by the so-called experts in one generation are often so different from those admired a few generations later. It's easy to conclude there's nothing real there at all. It's only when you isolate this force, for example by trying to paint and comparing your work to Bellini's, that you can see that it does in fact exist."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some people question whether art can possess inherent goodness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other reason people doubt that art can be good is that there doesn't seem to be any room in the art for this goodness. The argument goes like this. Imagine several people looking at a work of art and judging how good it is. If being good art really is a property of objects, it should be in the object somehow.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the effectiveness of art be compared to that of a vaccine in terms of its impact on individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because people's responses to art aren't random, art can be designed to operate on people, and be good or bad depending on how effectively it does so. Much as a vaccine can be. If someone were talking about the ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem very frivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn't really a property of vaccines, because acquiring immunity is something that happens in the immune system of each individual person. Sure, people's immune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not work on another, but that doesn't make it meaningless to talk about the effectiveness of a vaccine."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one assess the effectiveness of art in comparison to more quantifiable fields like medicine?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The situation with art is messier, of course. You can't measure effectiveness by simply taking a vote, as you do with vaccines. You have to imagine the responses of subjects with a deep knowledge of art, and enough clarity of mind to be able to ignore extraneous influences like the fame of the artist. And even then you'd still see some disagreement. People do vary, and judging art is hard, especially recent art. There is definitely not a total order either of works or of people's ability to judge them. But there is equally definitely a partial order of both. So while it's not possible to have perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste."}]}

I spent so many years thinking it was. The circumstances of childhood are a perfect storm for fostering this illusion.

The other way is when multiple people work on separate projects of their own that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. For example, when one person writes the text of a book and another does the graphic design."}]}

People like Burrell Smith and Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson and Susan Kare were not just following orders. They were not tennis balls hit by Steve Jobs, but rockets let loose by Steve Jobs.

Not only is the market price of unsolved problems higher, you also get a discount on productivity when you work on them.

It's harder when they're not. And the hardest part, usually, is morale. That's where adults have it harder than kids. Kids just plunge in and build their treehouse without worrying about whether they're wasting their time, or how it compares to other treehouses. And frankly we could learn a lot from kids here. The high standards most grownups have for \"real\" work do not always serve us well."}]}

Kids bounce, or are herded, from one kind of work to the next, barely realizing what's happening to them. Whereas we know more about different types of work and have more control over which we do. Ideally we can have the best of both worlds: to be deliberate in choosing to work on projects of our own, and carelessly confident in starting new ones."}]}

It's hard to say if its recent, narrower meaning is a change for the better or the worse. For sure there are lots of false positives — lots of projects that end up being important but are dismissed initially as mere hobbies.

The optimal organization would combine collaboration and ownership in such a way as to do the least damage to each. Interestingly, companies and university departments approach this ideal from opposite directions: companies insist on collaboration, and occasionally also manage both to recruit skaters and allow them to skate, and university departments insist on the ability to do independent research (which is by custom treated as skating, whether it is or not), and the people they hire collaborate as much as they choose."}]}

In ordinary social situations they are — as quiet and diffident as the star quarterback would be if he found himself in the middle of a physics symposium.

In fact some nerds are quite fierce."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics define the competitive nature of the fierce nerds compared to non-nerds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fierce nerds are a small but interesting group. They are as a rule extremely competitive — more competitive, I'd say, than highly competitive non-nerds. Competition is more personal for them. Partly perhaps because they're not emotionally mature enough to distance themselves from it, but also because there's less randomness in the kinds of competition they engage in, and they are thus more justified in taking the results personally."}]}

Especially early on, nerds spend so much of their time in ordinary social situations and so little doing real work that they get a lot more evidence of their awkwardness than their power.

Fierce nerds would do well to remember this, and (a) try to keep a lid on it, and (b) seek out organizations and types of work where getting the right answer matters more than preserving social harmony.

Someone proposes an idea that sounds crazy, most people dismiss it, then it gradually takes over the world."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why should we consider seemingly implausible ideas proposed by experts in their field?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely dismissed. But not when they're proposed by reasonable domain experts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they know how implausible it sounds. And yet they're proposing it anyway. That suggests they know something you don't. And if they have deep domain expertise, that's probably the source of it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might implausible-sounding ideas from domain experts be more valuable than those from the average person?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Such ideas are not merely unsafe to dismiss, but disproportionately likely to be interesting. When the average person proposes an implausible-sounding idea, its implausibility is evidence of their incompetence. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, the situation is reversed. There's something like an efficient market here: on average the ideas that seem craziest will, if correct, have the biggest effect. So if you can eliminate the theory that the person proposing an implausible-sounding idea is incompetent, its implausibility switches from evidence that it's boring to evidence that it's exciting."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do new ideas often struggle to gain acceptance in current discussions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason is that everyone is too conservative. The word \"paradigm\" is overused, but this is a case where it's warranted. Everyone is too much in the grip of the current paradigm. Even the people who have the new ideas undervalue them initially. Which means that before they reach the stage of proposing them publicly, they've already subjected them to an excessively strict filter."}]}

Why has this smart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong? Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be. If you're the one who's mistaken, that would be good to know, because it means there's a hole in your model of the world. But even if they're mistaken, it should be interesting to learn why.

If you propose a radical new idea and it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth) will increase proportionally. Some people would be envious if that happened, and this potential envy propagates back into a conviction that you must be wrong."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some people tend to reject new ideas in favor of established beliefs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it's an easy way to seem sophisticated. When a new idea first emerges, it usually seems pretty feeble. It's a mere hatchling. Received wisdom is a full-grown eagle by comparison. So it's easy to launch a devastating attack on a new idea, and anyone who does will seem clever to those who don't understand this asymmetry."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the rewards differ for those innovating new ideas compared to those critiquing them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This phenomenon is exacerbated by the difference between how those working on new ideas and those attacking them are rewarded. The rewards for working on new ideas are weighted by the value of the outcome. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better. Whereas the rewards for attacking new ideas are roughly constant; such attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do individuals often resist new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest in the old ones.

It doesn't just affect the way we think; it is the Lego blocks we build thoughts out of. Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people can do. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at first, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his instruments over his sense of balance."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do established paradigms influence the acceptance of new scientific ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Paradigms don't just define our present thinking. They also vacuum up the trail of crumbs that led to them, making our standards for new ideas impossibly high. The current paradigm seems so perfect to us, its offspring, that we imagine it must have been accepted completely as soon as it was discovered — that whatever the church thought of the heliocentric model, astronomers must have been convinced as soon as Copernicus proposed it. Far, in fact, from it. Copernicus published the heliocentric model in 1532, but it wasn't till the mid seventeenth century that the balance of scientific opinion shifted in its favor."}]}

Court-appointed defense attorneys are overworked and often incompetent. There's a ready supply of criminals willing to give false testimony in return for a lighter sentence, suggestible witnesses who can be made to say whatever police want, and bogus \"experts\" eager to claim that science proves the defendant is guilty.

If you only look back as far as the mid 20th century, it seems like people getting rich by starting their own companies is a recent phenomenon. But if you look back further, you realize it's actually the default. So what we should expect in the future is more of the same. Indeed, we should expect both the number and wealth of founders to grow, because every decade it gets easier to start a startup."}]}

Society is (re)assimilating the concept. If you start one now, your parents won't freak out the way they would have a generation ago, and knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread. But the main reason it's easier to start a startup now is that it's cheaper. Technology has driven down the cost of both building products and acquiring customers."}]}

Lower taxes are not just a cause of entrepreneurship, but an effect as well: the people getting rich in the mid 20th century from real estate and oil exploration lobbied for and got huge tax loopholes that made their effective tax rate much lower, and presumably if it had been more common to grow big companies by building new technology, the people doing that would have lobbied for their own loopholes as well."}]}

The typical startup does some of each. Obviously you end up richer if you keep more stock, but you should also end up richer if you raise more money, because (a) it should make the company more successful, and (b) you should be able to last longer before the next round, or not even need one.

The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear."}]}

The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book.

In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths.

Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll.

It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work.

I kept the code tight and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on.

We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we set the price low.

And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough, you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year.

Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches.

My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me.

Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.

Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined."}]}

I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once said about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second part that scared me.

It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my attention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too.

We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC.

For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned."}]}

It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine.

The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question."}]}

Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What limitations did McCarthy face when developing his 1960 Lisp interpreter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way — indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough."}]}

Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019.

I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools.

Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare.

In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders.

When you run a forum, you're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you're present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it's correct.

There have to be some people who want what you're building right now, and want it so urgently that they're willing to use it, bugs and all, even though you're a small company they've never heard of. There don't have to be many, but there have to be some.

We couldn't ask them a question they didn't know the answer to. We ourselves were not very excited about the idea as users, but we knew this didn't prove anything, because there were lots of successful startups we hadn't been excited about as users. We were able to say to ourselves \"They seem to know what they're talking about. Maybe they're onto something.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do YC partners assess the market potential of ideas presented by founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This may sound strangely credulous, but the YC partners want to rely on the founders to tell them about the market. Think about how VCs typically judge the potential market for an idea. They're not ordinarily domain experts themselves, so they forward the idea to someone who is, and ask for their opinion. YC doesn't have time to do this, but if the YC partners can convince themselves that the founders both (a) know what they're talking about and (b) aren't lying, they don't need outside domain experts. They can use the founders themselves as domain experts when evaluating their own idea."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are YC interviews structured as short, question-and-answer sessions rather than traditional pitches?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is why YC interviews aren't pitches. To give as many founders as possible a chance to get funded, we made interviews as short as we could: 10 minutes. That is not enough time for the partners to figure out, through the indirect evidence in a pitch, whether you know what you're talking about and aren't lying.

In other words, turn the interview into a pitch. ⟨elaborate expletive⟩. It is so annoying when people try to do that. You ask them a question, and instead of answering it, they deliver some obviously prefabricated blob of pitch. It eats up 10 minutes really fast."}]}

People who've merely been interviewed, even successfully, have no idea of this, but interviews take all sorts of different forms depending on what the partners want to know about most. Sometimes they're all about the founders, other times they're all about the idea. Sometimes some very narrow aspect of the idea. Founders sometimes walk away from interviews complaining that they didn't get to explain their idea completely. True, but they explained enough."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies should candidates use to effectively answer questions during a YC interview?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since a YC interview consists of questions, the way to do it well is to answer them well. Part of that is answering them candidly. The partners don't expect you to know everything. But if you don't know the answer to a question, don't try to bullshit your way out of it. The partners, like most experienced investors, are professional bullshit detectors, and you are (hopefully) an amateur bullshitter. And if you try to bullshit them and fail, they may not even tell you that you failed. So it's better to be honest than to try to sell them. If you don't know the answer to a question, say you don't, and tell them how you'd go about finding it, or tell them the answer to some related question."}]}

Far better to go into gruesome detail. That's what experts do when you ask what could go wrong.  The partners know that your idea is risky. That's what a good bet looks like at this stage: a tiny probability of a huge outcome."}]}

Competitors are rarely what kills startups. Poor execution does. But you should know who your competitors are, and tell the YC partners candidly what your relative strengths and weaknesses are. Because the YC partners know that competitors don't kill startups, they won't hold competitors against you too much. They will, however, hold it against you if you seem either to be unaware of competitors, or to be minimizing the threat they pose. They may not be sure whether you're clueless or lying, but they don't need to be."}]}

That in turn depends on three things: the general qualities of the founders, their specific expertise in this domain, and the relationship between them. How determined are the founders?

So that's what YC looks for in founders: authenticity. People's motives for starting startups are usually mixed. They're usually doing it from some combination of the desire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuine interest in the problem, and unwillingness to work for someone else. The last two are more powerful motivators than the first two. It's ok for founders to want to make money or to seem cool. Most do. But if the founders seem like they're doing it"}]}

YC is a magnet for them, because they want the YC brand. But when the YC partners detect someone like that, they reject them. If bad people made good founders, the YC partners would face a moral dilemma. Fortunately they don't, because bad people make bad founders.

Then it moves on to the users, which is also disastrous, because the sort of early adopters a successful startup wants as its initial users are the hardest to fool. The best this kind of founder can hope for is to keep the edifice of deception tottering along until some acquirer can be tricked into buying it. But that kind of acquisition is never very big."}]}

But something surprising happened: they enjoyed having those first three guests staying with them. And the guests enjoyed it too. Both they and the guests had done it because they were in a sense forced to, and yet they'd all had a great experience.

The founders and early employees are almost always independent-minded; otherwise the startup wouldn't be successful. But conventional-minded people greatly outnumber independent-minded ones, so as the company grows, the original spirit of independent-mindedness is inevitably diluted.

Although universities no longer have the kind of monopoly they used to have on education, good universities are still an excellent way to meet independent-minded people.

When I meet someone who knows a lot about something unusual (which includes practically everyone, if you dig deep enough), I try to learn what they know that other people don't.

The end goal is not to find flaws in the things you're told, but to find the new ideas that had been concealed by the broken ones. So this game should be an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for intellectual hygiene.

It's not enough just to have resistance to being told what to think. Those kind of people reject conventional ideas only to replace them with the most random conspiracy theories.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the components of truth, fastidiousness, and curiosity interact to enhance knowledge and understanding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Interestingly, the three components can substitute for one another in much the same way muscles can. If you're sufficiently fastidious about truth, you don't need to be as resistant to being told what to think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gaps in your knowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity, because if you create enough space in your brain, your discomfort at the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or curiosity can compensate for them: if you're sufficiently curious, you don't need to clear space in your brain, because the new ideas you discover will push out the conventional ones you acquired by default."}]}

It's sort of like the definition of a gentleman as someone who is never unintentionally rude."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do political extremists demonstrate conformity despite believing they are nonconformists?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You see this especially among political extremists. They think themselves nonconformists, but actually they're niche conformists. Their opinions may be different from the average person's, but they are often more influenced by their peers' opinions than the average person's are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the definition of fastidiousness about truth enhance our understanding of independent-mindedness in the arts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If we broaden the concept of fastidiousness about truth so that it excludes pandering, bogusness, and pomposity as well as falsehood in the strict sense, our model of independent-mindedness can expand further into the arts."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics might indicate a person is conventional-minded?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This correlation is far from perfect, though. Gödel and Dirac don't seem to have been very strong in the humor department. But someone who is both \"neurotypical\" and humorless is very likely to be conventional-minded."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What prevents many individuals from starting and completing meaningful projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on where they don't seem very impressive, even to their creators. You have to push through this stage to reach the great work that lies beyond. But many people don't. Most people don't even reach the stage of making something they're embarrassed by, let alone continue past it. They're too frightened even to start."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the pace of innovation changed over time in human history?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Making new things is itself a new thing for us as a species. It has always happened, but till the last few centuries it happened so slowly as to be invisible to individual humans. And since we didn't need customs for dealing with new ideas, we didn't develop any."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do we struggle to evaluate ambitious projects during their early stages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We just don't have enough experience with early versions of ambitious projects to know how to respond to them. We judge them as we would judge more finished work, or less ambitious projects. We don't realize they're a special case."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an example of a place that fosters innovative thinking and encourages unconventional ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Or at least, most of us don't. One reason I'm confident we can do better is that it's already starting to happen. There are already a few places that are living in the future in this respect. Silicon Valley is one of them: an unknown person working on a strange-sounding idea won't automatically be dismissed the way they would back home. In Silicon Valley, people have learned how dangerous that is."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What skills are necessary for evaluating new ideas in a high-stakes environment like Y Combinator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "entirely, from listing the reasons an idea won't work to trying to think of ways it could. That's what I do when I meet people with new ideas. I've become quite good at it, but I've had a lot of practice. Being a partner at Y Combinator means being practically immersed in strange-sounding ideas proposed by unknown people. Every six months you get thousands of new ones thrown at you and have to sort through them, knowing that in a world with a power-law distribution of outcomes, it will be painfully obvious if you miss the needle in this haystack. Optimism becomes urgent."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What potential impact could widespread optimism have on society and its customs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I'm hopeful that, with time, this kind of optimism can become widespread enough that it becomes a social custom, not just a trick used by a few specialists. It is after all an extremely lucrative trick, and those tend to spread quickly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to harsh criticism of early-stage projects in the startup world?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course, inexperience is not the only reason people are too harsh on early versions of ambitious projects. They also do it to seem clever. And in a field where the new ideas are risky, like startups, those who dismiss them are in fact more likely to be right. Just not when their predictions are"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological factors contribute to the dismissal of ambitious new ideas by others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But there is another more sinister reason people dismiss new ideas. If you try something ambitious, many of those around you will hope, consciously or unconsciously, that you'll fail. They worry that if you try something ambitious and succeed, it will put you above them. In some countries this is not just an individual failing but part of the national culture."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often hope for your success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason many hope you'll succeed is that they hope to rise with you. For investors this incentive is particularly explicit. They want you to succeed because they hope you'll make them rich in the process. But many other people you meet can hope to benefit in some way from your success. At the very least they'll be able to say, when you're famous, that they've known you since way back."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the culture of supporting startups in Silicon Valley evolved over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But even if Silicon Valley's encouraging attitude is rooted in self-interest, it has over time actually grown into a sort of benevolence. Encouraging startups has been practiced for so long that it has become a custom. Now it just seems that that's what one does with startups."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is Silicon Valley overly optimistic about the authenticity of its startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe Silicon Valley is too optimistic. Maybe it's too easily fooled by impostors. Many less optimistic journalists want to believe that. But the lists of impostors they cite are suspiciously short, and plagued with asterisks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can cultural attitudes towards new ideas evolve to encourage innovation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a lot more to new ideas than new startup ideas, of course. The fear of making something lame holds people back in every field. But Silicon Valley shows how quickly customs can evolve to support new ideas. And that in turn proves that dismissing new ideas is not so deeply rooted in human nature that it can't be unlearnt."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can you overcome self-doubt when trying to pursue new creative endeavors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Unfortunately, if you want to do new things, you'll face a force more powerful than other people's skepticism: your own skepticism. You too will judge your early work too harshly. How do you avoid that?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one manage the fear of producing poor work while still maintaining motivation to create?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is a difficult problem, because you don't want to completely eliminate your horror of making something lame. That's what steers you toward doing good work. You just want to turn it off temporarily, the way a painkiller temporarily turns off pain."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does self-promotion play in the effectiveness of a professor's teaching?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good work is not done by \"humble\" men. It is one of the first duties of a professor, for example, in any subject, to exaggerate a little both the importance of his subject and his importance in it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can misjudgments in goal assessment affect the perceived value of progress?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you overestimate the importance of what you're working on, that will compensate for your mistakenly harsh judgment of your initial results. If you look at something that's 20% of the way to a goal worth 100 and conclude that it's 10% of the way to a goal worth 200, your estimate of its expected value is correct even though both components are wrong."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological advantage does slight overconfidence provide in achieving success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It also helps, as Hardy suggests, to be slightly overconfident. I've noticed in many fields that the most successful people are slightly overconfident. On the face of it this seems implausible. Surely it would be optimal to have exactly the right estimate of one's abilities. How could it be an advantage to be mistaken? Because this error compensates for other sources of error in the opposite direction: being slightly overconfident armors you against both other people's skepticism and your own."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential benefits of ignorance in the evaluation of early work, particularly for young individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ignorance has a similar effect. It's safe to make the mistake of judging early work as finished work if you're a sufficiently lax judge of finished work. I doubt it's possible to cultivate this kind of ignorance, but empirically it's a real advantage, especially for the young."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can collaborating with the right colleagues enhance the progress of ambitious projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another way to get through the lame phase of ambitious projects is to surround yourself with the right people — to create an eddy in the social headwind. But it's not enough to collect people who are always encouraging. You'd learn to discount that. You need colleagues who can actually tell an ugly duckling from a baby swan. The people best able to do this are those working on similar projects of their own, which is why university departments and research labs work so well. You don't need institutions to collect colleagues. They naturally coalesce, given the chance. But it's very much worth accelerating this process by seeking out other people trying to do new things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities should one look for in a good teacher, and why are they valuable?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Teachers are in effect a special case of colleagues. It's a teacher's job both to see the promise of early work and to encourage you to continue. But teachers who are good at this are unfortunately quite rare, so if you have the opportunity to learn from one, take it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do individuals face when trying to maintain discipline in the face of initial difficulties, especially as they age?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For some it might work to rely on sheer discipline: to tell yourself that you just have to press on through the initial crap phase and not get discouraged. But like a lot of \"just tell yourself\" advice, this is harder than it sounds. And it gets still harder as you get older, because your standards rise. The old do have one compensating advantage though: they've been through this before."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can focusing on the rate of improvement rather than the current position alleviate concerns about the quality of work when starting something new?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It can help if you focus less on where you are and more on the rate of change. You won't worry so much about doing bad work if you can see it improving. Obviously the faster it improves, the easier this is. So when you start something new, it's good if you can spend a lot of time on it. That's another advantage of being young: you tend to have bigger blocks of time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy can be used to overcome the pressure of perfectionism when starting a new creative project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another common trick is to start by considering new work to be of a different, less exacting type. To start a painting saying that it's just a sketch, or a new piece of software saying that it's just a quick hack. Then you judge your initial results by a lower standard. Once the project is rolling you can sneakily convert it to something more."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of medium is recommended for quick and low-commitment creative work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This will be easier if you use a medium that lets you work fast and doesn't require too much commitment up front. It's easier to convince yourself that something is just a sketch when you're drawing in a notebook than when you're carving stone. Plus you get initial results faster."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset can help one approach risky projects to maximize learning outcomes, even in the event of failure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It will be easier to try out a risky project if you think of it as a way to learn and not just as a way to make something. Then even if the project truly is a failure, you'll still have gained by it. If the problem is sharply enough defined, failure itself is knowledge: if the theorem you're trying to prove turns out to be false, or you use a structural member of a certain size and it fails under stress, you've learned something, even if it isn't what you wanted to learn."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What personal motivation drives your entrepreneurial ventures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One motivation that works particularly well for me is curiosity.

Having worked for so long with various dialects of Lisp, I was very curious to see what its inherent shape was: what you'd end up with if you followed the axiomatic approach all the way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to reframe your perception of early efforts in an ambitious project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But it's a bit strange that you have to play mind games with yourself to avoid being discouraged by lame-looking early efforts. The thing you're trying to trick yourself into believing is in fact the truth. A lame-looking early version of an ambitious project truly is more valuable than it seems. So the ultimate solution may be to teach yourself that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What can we learn from the early efforts of successful individuals in their fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to do it is to study the histories of people who've done great work. What were they thinking early on? What was the very first thing they did? It can sometimes be hard to get an accurate answer to this question, because people are often embarrassed by their earliest work and make little effort to publish it. (They too misjudge it.) But when you can get an accurate picture of the first steps someone made on the path to some great work, they're often pretty feeble."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can studying early work help improve your judgment and confidence in your own creative process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perhaps if you study enough such cases, you can teach yourself to be a better judge of early work. Then you'll be immune both to other people's skepticism and your own fear of making something lame. You'll see early work for what it is."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can we improve our evaluation of early work without being overly critical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Curiously enough, the solution to the problem of judging early work too harshly is to realize that our attitudes toward it are themselves early work. Holding everything to the same standard is a crude version 1. We're already evolving better customs, and we can already see signs of how big the payoff will be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why were Silicon Valley investors skeptical of Theranos despite media enthusiasm?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of their great favorites is Theranos. But the most conspicuous feature of Theranos's cap table is the absence of Silicon Valley firms. Journalists were fooled by Theranos, but Silicon Valley investors weren't."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What misconceptions did the author have about the qualities that define a good teacher?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I made two mistakes about teachers when I was younger.  I cared more about professors' research than their reputations as teachers, and I was also wrong about what it meant to be a good teacher. I thought it simply meant to be good at explaining things."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is one key benefit of transitioning from physical to digital media?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Much of the advantage of switching from physical to digital media is not the software per se but that it lets you start something new with little upfront commitment."}]}

Many careers were born from that, but as the commercial game quality improved over the years, it became almost a full time job to make a successful mod that would be appreciated by the community. This was dramatically reversed with Minecraft and later Roblox, where the entire esthetic of the experience was so explicitly crude that innovative gameplay concepts became the overriding value. These \"crude\" game mods by single authors are now often bigger deals than massive professional teams' work."}]}

That way there's no such thing as failing, since you learn something no matter what.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do wealth taxes differ from income taxes in terms of their long-term impact on assets?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It may at first seem surprising that such apparently small tax rates produce such dramatic effects. A 2% wealth tax with a $50 million threshold takes about two thirds of a successful founder's stock.The reason wealth taxes have such dramatic effects is that they're applied over and over to the same money. Income tax happens every year, but only to that year's income. Whereas if you live for 60 years after acquiring some asset, a wealth tax will tax that same asset 60 times. A wealth tax compounds.Note[1In practice, eventually some of this 8% would come in the form of dividends, which are taxed as income at issue, so this model actually represents the most optimistic case for the founder."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can individuals be classified based on their conformism and mindset?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most revealing ways to classify people is by the degree and aggressiveness of their conformism. Imagine a Cartesian coordinate system whose horizontal axis runs from conventional-minded on the left to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axis runs from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The resulting four quadrants define four types of people. Starting in the upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively conventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively independent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence which quadrant individuals fall into within societal types?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think that you'll find all four types in most societies, and that which quadrant people fall into depends more on their own personality than the beliefs prevalent in their society."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do young children demonstrate about the influence of individual traits versus arbitrary rules in determining behavior types?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Young children offer some of the best evidence for both points. Anyone who's been to primary school has seen the four types, and the fact that school rules are so arbitrary is strong evidence that which quadrant people fall into depends more on them than the rules."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics define the children who tend to report rule-breaking behavior?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The kids in the upper left quadrant, the aggressively conventional-minded ones, are the tattletales. They believe not only that rules must be obeyed, but that those who disobey them must be punished."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characterizes the mindset of children who are considered passively conventional-minded?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The kids in the lower left quadrant, the passively conventional-minded, are the sheep. They're careful to obey the rules, but when other kids break them, their impulse is to worry that those kids will be punished, not to ensure that they will."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics define the children in the lower right quadrant of the independence spectrum?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The kids in the lower right quadrant, the passively independent-minded, are the dreamy ones.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics define the behavior of children who are classified as aggressively independent-minded?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And the kids in the upper right quadrant, the aggressively independent-minded, are the naughty ones. When they see a rule, their first impulse is to question it. Merely being told what to do makes them inclined to do the opposite."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the influence of peers on conformism change as children grow older?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When measuring conformism, of course, you have to say with respect to what, and this changes as kids get older. For younger kids it's the rules set by adults. But as kids get older, the source of rules becomes their peers. So a pack of teenagers who all flout school rules in the same way are not independent-minded; rather the opposite."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the four types of adult mindsets and how are they characterized?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In adulthood we can recognize the four types by their distinctive calls, much as you could recognize four species of birds. The call of the aggressively conventional-minded is \"Crush <outgroup>!\" (It's rather alarming to see an exclamation point after a variable, but that's the whole problem with the aggressively conventional-minded.) The call of the passively conventional-minded is \"What will the neighbors think?\" The call of the passively independent-minded is \"To each his own.\" And the call of the aggressively independent-minded is \"Eppur si muove.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the relative sizes of the different personality types mentioned in the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The four types are not equally common. There are more passive people than aggressive ones, and far more conventional-minded people than independent-minded ones. So the passively conventional-minded are the largest group, and the aggressively independent-minded the smallest."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does personality influence the quadrant a person occupies, regardless of societal rules?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since one's quadrant depends more on one's personality than the nature of the rules, most people would occupy the same quadrant even if they'd grown up in a quite different society."}]}

And indeed, our default assumption should not merely be that his students would, on average, have behaved the same way people did at the time, but that the ones who are aggressively conventional-minded today would have been aggressively conventional-minded then too. In other words, that they'd not only not have fought against slavery, but that they'd have been among its staunchest defenders."}]}

In particular, the retirement of the concept of heresy and its replacement by the principle of freely debating all sorts of different ideas, even ones that are currently considered unacceptable, without any punishment for those who try them out to see if they work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to protect independent-minded individuals in society?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why do the independent-minded need to be protected, though? Because they have all the new ideas. To be a successful scientist, for example, it's not enough just to be right. You have to be right when everyone else is wrong. Conventional-minded people can't do that. For similar reasons, all successful startup CEOs are not merely independent-minded, but aggressively so. So it's no coincidence that societies prosper only to the extent that they have customs for keeping the conventional-minded at bay."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What concerns have been raised about the state of free inquiry in recent years?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the last few years, many of us have noticed that the customs protecting free inquiry have been weakened. Some say we're overreacting — that they haven't been weakened very much, or that they've been weakened in the service of a greater good. The latter I'll dispose of immediately. When the conventional-minded get the upper hand, they always say it's in the service of a greater good.  It just happens to be a different, incompatible greater good each time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are independent-minded individuals particularly attuned to changes in the freedom of idea exploration?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As for the former worry, that the independent-minded are being oversensitive, and that free inquiry hasn't been shut down that much, you can't judge that unless you are yourself independent-minded. You can't know how much of the space of ideas is being lopped off unless you have them, and only the independent-minded have the ones at the edges. Precisely because of this, they tend to be very sensitive to changes in how freely one can explore ideas. They're the canaries in this coalmine."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to discuss even controversial or \"bad\" ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You'd think it would be obvious just from that sentence what a dangerous game they're playing.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential consequences of banning the discussion of certain ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The second reason it's dangerous to ban the discussion of ideas is that ideas are more closely related than they look. Which means if you restrict the discussion of some topics, it doesn't only affect those topics. The restrictions propagate back into any topic that yields implications in the forbidden ones. And that is not an edge case. The best ideas do exactly that: they have consequences in fields far removed from their origins. Having ideas in a world where some ideas are banned is like playing soccer on a pitch that has a minefield in one corner. You don't just play the same game you would have, but on a different shaped pitch. You play a much more subdued game even on the ground that's safe."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What historical role have universities played in safeguarding independent thought and free inquiry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the past, the way the independent-minded protected themselves was to congregate in a handful of places —  first in courts, and later in universities — where they could to some extent make their own rules. Places where people work with ideas tend to have customs protecting free inquiry, for the same reason wafer fabs have powerful air filters, or recording studios good sound insulation. For the last couple centuries at least, when the aggressively conventional-minded were on the rampage for whatever reason, universities were the safest places to be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role has social media played in the resurgence of intolerance that originated in universities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That may not work this time though, due to the unfortunate fact that the latest wave of intolerance began in universities. It began in the mid 1980s, and by 2000 seemed to have died down, but it has recently flared up again with the arrival of social media. This seems, unfortunately, to have been an own goal by Silicon Valley. Though the people who run Silicon Valley are almost all independent-minded, they've handed the aggressively conventional-minded a tool such as they could only have dreamed of."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact has the departure of independent-minded individuals had on the current state of academic freedom in universities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "On the other hand, perhaps the decline in the spirit of free inquiry within universities is as much the symptom of the departure of the independent-minded as the cause. People who would have become professors 50 years ago have other options now. Now they can become quants or start startups. You have to be independent-minded to succeed at either of those. If these people had been professors, they'd have put up a stiffer resistance on behalf of academic freedom. So perhaps the picture of the independent-minded fleeing declining universities is too gloomy. Perhaps the universities are declining because so many have already left."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the consequences of orthodox privilege on discussions of truth and heresy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the most extreme cases, people suffering from orthodox privilege will not only deny that there's anything true that you can't say, but will accuse you of heresy merely for saying there is. Though if there's more than one heresy current in your time, these accusations will be weirdly non-deterministic: you must either be an xist or a yist."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the main challenge in overcoming orthodox privilege compared to other forms of privilege?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, this is a uniquely tenacious form of privilege. People can overcome the blindness induced by most forms of privilege by learning more about whatever they're not. But they can't overcome orthodox privilege just by learning more.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might individuals from conventional demographics fail to recognize their privilege?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But in general I don't think it will work to say \"check your privilege\" about this type of privilege, because those in its demographic don't realize they're in it.

They didn't realize there was any danger in making false predictions.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some common flaws in academic writing that can undermine the clarity of statements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough merely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by making it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes useful writing from less effective statements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing.

But if I say it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because it's a bit east of the middle."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do precision and correctness interact in effective writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues. Useful writing is bold, but true."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between surprising someone with new information and providing insights that they unconsciously knew?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean surprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more fundamental."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key characteristics of effective writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's put them all together. Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean for an idea to be considered novel in the context of a large population?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can't expect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's 7 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot of readers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the components of correctness, importance, and strength be quantified to assess usefulness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but nonetheless true."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy can help ensure that your statements are meaningful and valuable?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and important? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. I learned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying anything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he's sure it's worth hearing. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him, but when you do, they're usually right."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should a writer do with unsatisfactory sentences or sections in their essay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write a bad sentence, you don't publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between publication bias in scientific research and essay writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered bad. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results, you're supposed to tell people about that too. But with essay writing, publication bias is the way to go."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is your approach to writing and revising essays?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an essay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewriting it very carefully."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's approach to proofreading essays before publication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but I'm sure there are sentences I've read 100 times before publishing them. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily written, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. The annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or so I'm saying \"Ugh, that part\" each time I hit it. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won't publish an essay till they're all gone — till I can read through the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you do if a sentence in your writing feels incorrect?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can't think of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through one that doesn't seem correct. You never have to. If a sentence doesn't seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn't, and you've usually got the replacement right there in your head."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key differences in the writing process between essayists and journalists?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You don't have a deadline. You can work for as long on an essay as you need to get it right. You don't have to publish the essay at all, if you can't get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the face of an enemy with unlimited resources. Or that's what it feels like. What's really going on is that you have different expectations for yourself. You're like a parent saying to a child \"we can sit here all night till you eat your vegetables.\" Except you're the child too."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can writers determine what topics will resonate with their audience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a trick for getting importance too. It's like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem important to you, they'll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two factors that determine the importance of something?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Importance has two factors. It's the number of people something matters to, times how much it matters to them. Which means of course that it's not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like a Riemann sum."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can writers ensure their work remains novel and engaging for readers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The way to get novelty is to write about topics you've thought about a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers. And here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you will. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't publish it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does confidence contribute to humility in recognizing new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of it. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in this case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble. If you know you're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit when you learn something you didn't know, because you can be confident that most other people wouldn't know it either."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two key factors that contribute to the strength of useful writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. These two counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch in a car with a manual transmission. As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something you're sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all, as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm's length with perhapses."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between refining an idea and the level of qualification it contains?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As you refine an idea, you're pushing in the direction of less qualification. But you can rarely get it down to zero. Sometimes you don't even want to, if it's a side point and a fully refined version would be too long."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might some writers choose to include phrases like \"I think\" in their writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some say that qualifications weaken writing. For example, that you should never begin a sentence in an essay with \"I think,\" because if you're saying it, then of course you think it. And it's true that \"I think x\" is a weaker statement than simply \"x.\" Which is exactly why you need \"I think.\" You need it to express your degree of certainty."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of understanding and using qualifications in effective communication and idea formulation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But qualifications are not scalars. They're not just experimental error. There must be 50 things they can express: how broadly something applies, how you know it, how happy you are it's so, even how it could be falsified. I'm not going to try to explore the structure of qualification here. It's probably more complex than the whole topic of writing usefully. Instead I'll just give you a practical tip: Don't underestimate qualification. It's an important skill in its own right, not just a sort of tax you have to pay in order to avoid saying things that are false. So learn and use its full range. It may not be fully half of having good ideas, but it's part of having them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates the author's preference for simplicity in writing essays?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible. But I don't think this is a component of usefulness. It's more a matter of consideration for the reader. And it's a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language. But I'll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader's sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program that's too long."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What elements contribute to writing a compelling essay, and what is a potential downside of this approach?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I believe the formula I've given you, importance + novelty + correctness + strength, is the recipe for a good essay. But I should warn you that it's also a recipe for making people mad."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the challenges associated with presenting novel ideas to people who hold cherished beliefs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The root of the problem is novelty. When you tell people something they didn't know, they don't always thank you for it. Sometimes the reason people don't know something is because they don't want to know it. Usually because it contradicts some cherished belief. And indeed, if you're looking for novel ideas, popular but mistaken beliefs are a good place to find them. Every popular mistaken belief creates a"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What effect does directly contradicting someone's cherished assumptions have on their feelings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The strength component just makes things worse. If there's anything that annoys people more than having their cherished assumptions contradicted, it's having them flatly contradicted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the Morris technique impact the perceived confidence of a writer's arguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Plus if you've used the Morris technique, your writing will seem quite confident. Perhaps offensively confident, to people who disagree with you. The reason you'll seem confident is that you are confident: you've cheated, by only publishing the things you're sure of.  It will seem to people who try to disagree with you that you never admit you're wrong. In fact you constantly admit you're wrong. You just do it before publishing instead of after."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the use of brevity in communication affect the perception of authority and rudeness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes things worse. Brevity is the diction of command. If you watch someone delivering unwelcome news from a position of inferiority, you'll notice they tend to use lots of words, to soften the blow. Whereas to be short with someone is more or less to be rude to them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might a writer choose to use tentative language in their statements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It can sometimes work to deliberately phrase statements more weakly than you mean. To put \"perhaps\" in front of something you're actually quite sure of. But you'll notice that when writers do this, they usually do it with a wink."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the author's views on the use of irony in writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't like to do this too much. It's cheesy to adopt an ironic tone for a whole essay. I think we just have to face the fact that elegance and curtness are two names for the same thing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might a well-written essay still face criticism despite being correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You might think that if you work sufficiently hard to ensure that an essay is correct, it will be invulnerable to attack. That's sort of true. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. But in practice that's little consolation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can strong language in writing lead to misrepresentation of ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, the strength component of useful writing will make you particularly vulnerable to misrepresentation. If you've stated an idea as strongly as you could without making it false, all anyone has to do is to exaggerate slightly what you said, and now it is false."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common misunderstanding occurs between writers and their critics during discussions or debates?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Much of the time they're not even doing it deliberately. One of the most surprising things you'll discover, if you start writing essays, is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with what you've actually written. Instead they make up something you said and disagree with that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a suggested strategy for addressing someone who claims your statements are false?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For what it's worth, the countermove is to ask someone who does this to quote a specific sentence or passage you wrote that they believe is false, and explain why. I say \"for what it's worth\" because they never do. So although it might seem that this could get a broken discussion back on track, the truth is that it was never on track in the first place."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might it be beneficial to address potential misinterpretations in communication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Should you explicitly forestall likely misinterpretations? Yes, if they're misinterpretations a reasonably smart and well-intentioned person might make. In fact it's sometimes better to say something slightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get an idea right in one shot. That can be more efficient, and can also model the way such an idea would be discovered."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on addressing potential misinterpretations in an essay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I don't think you should explicitly forestall intentional misinterpretations in the body of an essay. An essay is a place to meet honest readers. You don't want to spoil your house by putting bars on the windows to protect against dishonest ones. The place to protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes. But don't think you can predict them all. People are as ingenious at misrepresenting you when you say something they don't want to hear as they are at coming up with rationalizations for things they want to do but know they shouldn't. I suspect it's the same skill."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the initial focus for improving essay writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As with most other things, the way to get better at writing essays is to practice. But how do you start? Now that we've examined the structure of useful writing, we can rephrase that question more precisely. Which constraint do you relax initially? The answer is, the first component of importance: the number of people who care about what you write."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should a beginner focus on when starting to write?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you narrow the topic sufficiently, you can probably find something you're an expert on. Write about that to start with. If you only have ten readers who care, that's fine. You're helping them, and you're writing. Later you can expand the breadth of topics you write about."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of writing essays without the intention of publishing them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other constraint you can relax is a little surprising: publication. Writing essays doesn't have to mean publishing them. That may seem strange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, but it worked for me. I wrote what amounted to essays in notebooks for about 15 years. I never published any of them and never expected to. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. But when the web came along I'd had a lot of practice."}]}

The answer to that question is probably the most exciting thing I've learned about essay writing. Nearly all of them are left to write."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors limited the development of essay writing during the print era?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "is an old form, it hasn't been assiduously cultivated. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there wasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many. You could publish essays if you were already well known for writing something else, like novels. Or you could write book reviews that you took over to express your own ideas. But there was not really a direct path to becoming an essayist. Which meant few essays got written, and those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What opportunities does the internet provide for aspiring writers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now, thanks to the internet, there's a path.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the reasons for our discomfort with feeling inexperienced or like a \"noob\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think the answer is that there are two sources of feeling like a noob: being stupid, and doing something novel. Our dislike of feeling like a noob is our brain telling us \"Come on, come on, figure this out.\" Which was the right thing to be thinking for most of human history. The life of hunter-gatherers was complex, but it didn't change as much as life does now. They didn't suddenly have to figure out what to do about cryptocurrency. So it made sense to be biased toward competence at existing problems over the discovery of new ones. It made sense for humans to dislike the feeling of being a noob, just as, in a world where food was scarce, it made sense for them to dislike the feeling of being hungry."}]}

But when you realize that you're dealing with a hater, and what a hater is, it's clear that it's a waste of time even to think about them.

Intentional moderates are trimmers, deliberately choosing a position mid-way between the extremes of right and left. Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they make up their own minds about each question, and the far right and far left are roughly equally wrong."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one differentiate between intentional and accidental moderates based on their opinion distribution?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the distribution of their opinions. If the far left opinion on some matter is 0 and the far right opinion 100, an intentional moderate's opinion on every question will be near 50.

The defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or the right, is to acquire one's opinions in bulk. You don't get to pick and choose. Your opinions about taxation can be predicted from your opinions about sex. And although intentional moderates might seem to be the opposite of ideologues, their beliefs (though in their case the word \"positions\" might be more accurate) are also acquired in bulk. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left, the intentional moderate must shift with it. Otherwise they stop being moderate."}]}

They may not care at all about questions that the left and right both think are terribly important. So you can only even measure the politics of an accidental moderate from the intersection of the questions they care about and those the left and right care about, and this can sometimes be vanishingly small."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do accidental moderates face compared to intentional moderates in a politically polarized environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by the extreme left.

They were dull and responsible and had no fun.  And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that, to be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind.

Some parents may have noticed that I wrote \"Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids.\" Of course the times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only noticed them when they made noise.

People don't talk about these much — the magic is hard to put into words, and all other parents know about them anyway — but one of the great things about having kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is nowhere else you'd rather be, and nothing else you'd rather be doing.  You don't have to be doing anything special. You could just be going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing them on the swings at the park. But you wouldn't trade these moments for anything. One doesn't tend to associate kids with peace, but that's what you feel.  You don't need to look any further than where you are right now."}]}

The younger ones, the recent graduates, had never faced a non-artificial test. They thought this was just how the world worked: that the first thing you did, when facing any kind of challenge, was to figure out what the trick was for hacking the test.

One common way for a good idea to be non-obvious is for it to be hidden in the shadow of some mistaken assumption that people are very attached to. But anything you discover from working on such an idea will tend to contradict the mistaken assumption that was concealing it.

Interest is much more unevenly distributed than ability. If natural ability is all you need to do great work, and natural ability is evenly distributed, you have to invent elaborate theories to explain the skewed distributions we see among those who actually do great work in various fields.

Five years ago they shifted the center of gravity of Silicon Valley from the peninsula to San Francisco.

Most 25 to 29 year olds want to live in the city, not down in the boring suburbs.  So whether they like it or not, founders know they have to be in the city.

They prefer walking, or bicycling, or taking public transport.  If you've been to San Francisco recently you can't help noticing the huge number of bicyclists.  And this is not just a fad that the twenty-somethings have adopted.  In this respect they have discovered a better way to live.  The beards will go, but not the bikes.

And while it's impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something.

Though most founders start out excited about the idea of getting rich, purely mercenary founders will usually take one of the big acquisition offers most successful startups get on the way up.  The founders who go on to the next stage tend to be driven by a sense of mission.  They have the same attachment to their companies that an artist or writer has to their work.

There is usually some injustice that is allowing economic inequality to turn into other forms of inequality, and that injustice is what we need to fix.

In a period when people are trying to hide wealth from the government, it will tend to be hidden from statistics too.

And the flattening effect wasn't limited to those under arms, because the US economy was conscripted too.  Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the National War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted to flatness.  And this national standardization of wages was so pervasive that its effects could still be seen years after the war ended."}]}

In the US, as in all the other Allied countries, the federal government was slow to give up the new powers it had acquired.  Indeed, in some respects the war didn't end in 1945; the enemy just switched to the Soviet Union.

Smaller companies were increasingly able to survive as formerly narrow channels to consumers broadened.  Markets themselves started to change faster, as whole new categories of products appeared.

But that is not how car companies operate today.  Now much of the design and manufacturing happens in a long supply chain, whose products the car companies ultimately assemble and sell.

One reason is that supplier networks take a while to evolve. In 1917, doing everything himself seemed to Ford the only way to get the scale he needed. And the second reason is that if you want to solve a problem using a network of cooperating companies, you have to be able to coordinate their efforts, and you can do that much better with computers.

Many of the mid-century oligopolies had been anointed by the federal government with policies (and in wartime, large orders) that kept out competitors.

To what extent were computers a precondition? It would take a book to answer that. Obviously the spread of computing power was a precondition for the rise of startups.  I suspect it was for most of what happened in finance too.  But was it a precondition for globalization or the LBO wave?  I don't know, but I wouldn't discount the possibility.  It may be that the refragmentation was driven by computers in the way the industrial revolution was driven by steam engines.  Whether or not computers were a precondition, they have certainly accelerated it."}]}

Why climb a corporate ladder that might be yanked out from under you?  Ambitious people started to think of a career less as climbing a single ladder than as a series of jobs that might be at different companies. More movement (or even potential movement) between companies introduced more competition in salaries.  Plus as companies became smaller it became easier to estimate how much an employee contributed to the company's revenue.  Both changes drove salaries toward market price. And since people vary dramatically in productivity, paying market price meant salaries started to diverge."}]}

That word is not much used now, because the phenomenon it describes is so taken for granted, but at the time it was a label for something novel. Yuppies were young professionals who made lots of money.  To someone in their twenties today, this wouldn't seem worth naming.  Why wouldn't young professionals make lots of money? But until the 1980s, being underpaid early in your career was part of what it meant to be a professional.  Young professionals were paying their dues, working their way up the ladder.  The rewards would come later.  What was novel about yuppies was that they wanted market price for the work they were doing now."}]}

That was still in the future.  Nor did they work for big companies. They were professionals working in fields like law, finance, and consulting.  But their example rapidly inspired their peers.  Once they saw that new BMW 325i, they wanted one too."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential consequences of widespread underpayment for entry-level positions in the job market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Underpaying people at the beginning of their career only works if everyone does it. Once some employer breaks ranks, everyone else has to, or they can't get good people.  And once started this process spreads through the whole economy, because at the beginnings of people's careers they can easily switch not merely employers but industries."}]}

As in the past there were multiple ways to do it. Some made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playing zero-sum games.

CEOs of big companies make more now than they used to, and I think much of the reason is prestige.  In 1960, corporate CEOs had immense prestige.  They were the winners of the only economic game in town. But if they made as little now as they did then, in real dollar terms, they'd seem like small fry compared to professional athletes and whiz kids making millions from startups and hedge funds.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the fragmentation of companies affect workers' wages and union influence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Meanwhile a similar fragmentation was happening at the other end of the economic scale.  As big companies' oligopolies became less secure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thus less willing to overpay for labor.  And as the Duplo world of a few big blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes — some of them overseas — it became harder for unions to enforce their monopolies.  As a result workers' wages also tended toward market price. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended to be lower.  Perhaps dramatically so, if automation had decreased the need for some kind of work."}]}

People who didn't care much for religion felt less pressure to go to church for appearances' sake, while those who liked it a lot opted for increasingly colorful forms. Some switched from meat loaf to tofu, and others to Hot Pockets. Some switched from driving Ford sedans to driving small imported cars, and others to driving SUVs.

In fact, for the entire period since the war, tax receipts have stayed close to 18% of GDP, despite dramatic changes in tax rates.

In many ways the New Deal was a sort of dress rehearsal for the measures the federal government took during wartime.  The wartime versions were much more drastic and more pervasive though.

They use different words, certainly.  But even those they use no more than necessary. And in my experience, the harder the subject, the more informally experts speak.

Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough people, it will all get done.  Partly because successful startups have lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one does in order to be successful.  In fact the large staffs of successful startups are probably more the effect of growth than the cause.

But (because the product is only moderately appealing) the growth never comes.  Now they're rapidly running out of runway.  They hope further investment will save them.

If you're doing really badly, meaning the company is about to die, you may as well talk to them, because you have nothing to lose.

The only way their performance is measured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitious ones will stop at nothing to achieve that.

Can you protect yourself against obsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decade investing in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting yourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do to succeed as a startup investor.  Most really good startup ideas look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically because some change in the world just switched them from bad to good.

If they can realize before other investors that some apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a huge amount of money.  But the incentives are more than just financial.

If you went out and hired 15 people before you even knew what you were building, you've created a broken company.  You need to figure out what you're building, and it will probably be easier to do that with a handful of people than 15. Plus those 15 people might not even be the ones you need for whatever you end up building.  So the solution may be to shrink and then figure out what direction to grow in.  After all, you're not doing those 15 people any favors if you fly the company into ground with them aboard.

It may seem facile to suggest a startup make more money, as if that could be done for the asking. Usually a startup is already trying as hard as it can to sell whatever it sells.  What I'm suggesting here is not so much to try harder to make money but to try to make money in a different way. For example, if you have only one person selling while the rest are writing code, consider having everyone work on selling.  What good will more code do you when you're out of business? If you have to write code to close a certain deal, go ahead; that follows from everyone working on selling.  But only work on whatever will get you the most revenue the soonest."}]}

I say consultingish because there is a long slippery slope from making products to pure consulting, and you don't have to go far down it before you start to offer something really attractive to customers. Although your product may not be very appealing yet, if you're a startup your programmers will often be way better than the ones your customers have.  Or you may have expertise in some new field they don't understand.  So if you change your sales conversations just a little from \"do you want to buy our product?\" to \"what do you need that you'd pay a lot for?\" you may find it's suddenly a lot easier to extract money from customers."}]}

Or rather, where you read them as promising to invest more, while they think they're just mentioning the possibility.  The way to solve this problem, if you have 8 months of runway or less, is to try to get the money right now.

I think there is a lot of opportunity there. It used to suck to be an angel investor.  You couldn't get access to the best deals, unless you got lucky like Andy Bechtolsheim, and when you did invest in a startup, VCs might try to strip you of your stock when they arrived later.  Now an angel can go to something like Demo Day or AngelList and have access to the same deals VCs do.  And the days when VCs could wash angels out of the cap table are long gone."}]}

Probably not, for two reasons.  One is that the scariness of starting a startup in the old days was a pretty effective filter.  Now that the cost of failing is becoming lower, we should expect founders to do it more.  That's not a bad thing.  It's common in technology for an innovation that decreases the cost of failure to increase the number of failures and yet leave you net ahead."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might the growth in the number of startups not lead to a proportional increase in successful big hits?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other reason the number of big hits won't grow proportionately to the number of startups is that there will start to be an increasing number of idea clashes.  Although the finiteness of the number of good ideas is not the reason there are only 15 big hits a year, the number has to be finite, and the more startups there are, the more we'll see multiple companies doing the same thing at the same time. It will be interesting, in a bad way, if idea clashes become a lot more common."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists tend to invest excessively at the series A stage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right now, VCs often knowingly invest too much money at the series A stage.  They do it because they feel they need to get a big chunk of each series A company to compensate for the opportunity cost of the board seat it consumes.  Which means when there is a lot of competition for a deal, the number that moves is the valuation (and thus amount invested) rather than the percentage of the company being sold.  Which means, especially in the case of more promising startups, that series A investors often make companies take more money than they want."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do venture capitalists determine the amounts raised in Series A funding rounds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some VCs lie and claim the company really needs that much.  Others are more candid, and admit their financial models require them to own a certain percentage of each company.  But we all know the amounts being raised in series A rounds are not determined by asking what would be best for the companies.  They're determined by VCs starting from the amount of the company they want to own, and the market setting the valuation and thus the amount invested."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors have contributed to the changing dynamics between venture capitalists and founders in funding rounds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like a lot of bad things, this didn't happen intentionally.  The VC business backed into it as their initial assumptions gradually became obsolete.  The traditions and financial models of the VC business were established when founders needed investors more.  In those days it was natural for founders to sell VCs a big chunk of their company in the series A round.  Now founders would prefer to sell less, and VCs are digging in their heels because they're not sure if they can make money buying less than 20% of each series A company."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What potential shift in Series A investment strategies could benefit early-stage venture capitalists?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason I describe this as a danger is that series A investors are increasingly at odds with the startups they supposedly serve, and that tends to come back to bite you eventually.  The reason I describe it as an opportunity is that there is now a lot of potential energy built up, as the market has moved away from VCs' traditional business model.  Which means the first VC to break ranks and start to do series A rounds for as much equity as founders want to sell (and with no \"option pool\" that comes only from the founders' shares) stands to reap huge benefits."}]}

Hell if I know.  But I bet that particular firm will end up ahead.  If one top-tier VC firm started to do series A rounds that started from the amount the company needed to raise and let the percentage acquired vary with the market, instead of the other way around, they'd instantly get almost all the best startups.  And that's where the money is."}]}

Over the last decade we've seen the percentage of the company sold in series A rounds creep inexorably downward.  40% used to be common.  Now VCs are fighting to hold the line at 20%.  But I am daily waiting for the line to collapse.  It's going to happen.  You may as well anticipate it, and look bold."}]}

It wouldn't be the first time that happened.  Venture capital is a business where occasional big successes generate hundredfold returns. How much confidence can you really have in financial models for something like that anyway?  The big successes only have to get a tiny bit less occasional to compensate for a 2x decrease in the stock sold in series A rounds."}]}

Founders are your customers, and the things they complain about are unsatisfied demand.  I've given two examples of things founders complain about most—investors who take too long to make up their minds, and excessive dilution in series A rounds—so those are good places to look now.

We couldn't talk meaningfully about revenues without including the numbers from the most successful startups, and we don't have those.  We often discuss revenue growth with the earlier stage startups, because that's how we gauge their progress, but when companies reach a certain size it gets presumptuous for a seed investor to do that."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do only 287 companies have established valuations despite many having raised funds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason only 287 have valuations is that the rest have mostly raised money on convertible notes, and although convertible notes often have valuation caps, a valuation cap is merely an upper bound on a valuation."}]}

It always will when you're trying to solve problems where there are no customs yet to guide you.  Maybe I can't plead Occam's razor; maybe I'm simply eccentric. But if I'm right about the acceleration of addictiveness, then this kind of lonely squirming to avoid it will increasingly be the fate of anyone who wants to get things done.  We'll increasingly be defined by what we say no to."}]}

Only in a limited way, without becoming a police state. And even then your restrictions would have undesirable side effects. \"Good\" and \"bad\" technological progress aren't sharply differentiated, so you'd find you couldn't slow the latter without also slowing the former.

If you'd asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by spending all their money.  That's how it happens in books and movies, because that's the colorful way to do it.  But in fact the way most fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through bad investments."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What financial activities can lead to significant losses without immediate awareness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's hard to spend a fortune without noticing.  Someone with ordinary tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of thousands of dollars without thinking \"wow, I'm spending a lot of money.\"  Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an eye."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often perceive spending on luxuries differently than making investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments doesn't.  Luxuries seem self-indulgent. And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery, you've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble.  Investing bypasses those alarms.  You're not spending the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another.  Which is why people trying to sell you expensive things say \"it's an investment.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges are associated with creating effective alarms for preventing bad investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The solution is to develop new alarms.  This can be a tricky business, because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes fairly counterintuitive."}]}

The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work.  When you spend time having fun, you know you're being self-indulgent.  Alarms start to go off fairly quickly.  If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd feel like something was terribly wrong.  Just thinking about it makes me wince.

I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV.  If I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into perdition.  But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work.  Dealing with email, for example.  You do it sitting at a desk.  It's not fun.  So it must be work."}]}

It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers, and perhaps all pre-industrial societies.  So nature and nurture combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more virtuous types.  And the worst thing is, they're not even fun."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often act extra friendly when meeting someone new?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When meeting people you don't know very well, the convention is to seem extra friendly.  You smile and say \"pleased to meet you,\" whether you are or not.  There's nothing dishonest about this.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for writers to adopt an ingratiating tone in persuasive essays?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason there's a convention of being ingratiating in print is that most essays are written to persuade.

Instead he'll spend most of his time talking about the noble effort made by the people who worked on it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do political conventions affect the truthfulness of communication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason these conventions are more dangerous is that they interact with the ideas.  Saying \"pleased to meet you\" is just something you prepend to a conversation, but the sort of spin added by politicians is woven through it.  We're starting to move from social lies to real lies."}]}

But though labor unions are shrinking now, it's not because present union leaders are any less courageous.  An employer couldn't get away with hiring thugs to beat up union leaders today, but if they did, I see no reason to believe today's union leaders would shrink from the challenge.  So I think it would be a mistake to attribute the decline of unions to some kind of decline in the people who run them.  Early union leaders were heroic, certainly, but we should not suppose that if unions have declined, it's because present union leaders are somehow inferior.  The cause must be external."}]}

But written this way it seems like a defense of present-day union organizers rather than an attack on early ones.  That makes it more persuasive to people who like unions, because it seems sympathetic to their cause."}]}

The degree of courage of past or present union leaders is beside the point; all that matters for the argument is that they're the same. But if you want to please people who are mistaken, you can't simply tell the truth.  You're always going to have to add some sort of padding to protect their misconceptions from bumping against reality."}]}

In fact, worse than arrogant: since readers are used to essays that try to please someone, an essay that displeases one side in a dispute reads as an attempt to pander to the other.  To a lot of pro-union readers, the first paragraph sounds like the sort of thing a right-wing radio talk show host would say to stir up his followers.  But it's not.  Something that curtly contradicts one's beliefs can be hard to distinguish from a partisan attack on them, but though they can end up in the same place they come from different sources."}]}

That's my goal, at least. And most surprising means most different from what people currently believe.  So writing to persuade and writing to discover are diametrically opposed.  The more your conclusions disagree with readers' present beliefs, the more effort you'll have to expend on selling your ideas rather than having them.  As you accelerate, this drag increases, till eventually you reach a point where 100% of your energy is devoted to overcoming it and you can't go any faster."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges does the author face when trying to express new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's hard enough to overcome one's own misconceptions without having to think about how to get the resulting ideas past other people's. I worry that if I wrote to persuade, I'd start to shy away unconsciously from ideas I knew would be hard to sell.  When I notice something surprising, it's usually very faint at first.  There's nothing more than a slight stirring of discomfort.  I don't want anything to get in the way of noticing it consciously."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What emotions and memories did the author experience while writing in a familiar academic style?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I had a strange feeling of being back in high school writing this.  To get a good grade you had to both write the sort of pious crap you were expected to, but also seem to be writing with conviction. The solution was a kind of method acting.  It was revoltingly familiar to slip back into it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What writing technique does the author use to engage readers without increasing word count?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Come to think of it, there is one way in which I deliberately pander to readers, because it doesn't change the number of words: I switch person.  This flattering distinction seems so natural to the average reader that they probably don't notice even when I switch in mid-sentence, though you tend to notice when it's done as conspicuously as this."}]}

If the content was what they were selling, why has the price of books or music or movies always depended mostly on the format?  Why didn't better content cost more?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do traditional publishing practices prioritize medium over content in pricing and value?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Almost every form of publishing has been organized as if the medium was what they were selling, and the content was irrelevant.

And the business of selling information to consumers has always been a marginal one.

Doesn't that show people will pay for content? Well, not really. iTunes is more of a tollbooth than a store.  Apple controls the default path onto the iPod.  They offer a convenient list of songs, and whenever you choose one they ding your credit card for a small amount, just below the threshold of attention. Basically, iTunes makes money by taxing people, not selling them stuff.  You can only do that if you own the channel, and even then you don't make much from it, because a toll has to be ignorable to work.  Once a toll becomes painful, people start to find ways around it, and that's pretty easy with digital content."}]}

Whoever controls the device sets the terms.  It's in their interest for content to be as cheap as possible, and since they own the channel, there's a lot they can do to drive prices down.

Software is a different business.  Software and content blur together in some of the most lightweight software, like casual games.  But those are usually free.

But there are limits to how well they'll be able to do that.  Once publishing—giving people copies—becomes the most natural way of distributing your content, it probably doesn't work to stick to old forms of distribution just because you make more that way.  If free copies of your content are available online, then you're competing with publishing's form of distribution, and that's just as bad as being a publisher."}]}

That's an alarming possibility when you have to give a talk in a few days.  What if you run out of ideas? The compartmentalized structure of the list of n things protects the writer from his own stupidity in much the same way it protects the reader.

Maybe you take out or rearrange or combine a few, but at every stage you have a valid (though initially low-res) list of n things.  It's like the sort of programming where you write a version 1 very quickly and then gradually modify it, but at every point have working code—or the style of painting where you begin with a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour, then spend a week cranking up the resolution."}]}

Most computer/software startups are now the first type, and most pharmaceutical startups the second.  When I talk about startups in this essay, I mean type I startups.  There is no difficulty making type II startups spread: all you have to do is fund medical research labs; commercializing whatever new discoveries the boffins throw off is as straightforward as building a new airport.

If you're part of a round led by someone else, that problem is solved for you.  But what if you're investing by yourself?  There's no real answer. There is no rational way to value an early stage startup.  The valuation reflects nothing more than the strength of the company's bargaining position.  If they really want you, either because they desperately need money, or you're someone who can help them a lot, they'll let you invest at a low valuation.  If they don't need you, it will be higher.

There is a surprising lack of correlation between how hot a deal a startup is and how well it ends up doing.

And all three of them, in their own startups, basically flew into a thermal: they hit a market growing so fast that it was all they could do to keep up with it.

It means he makes up his mind quickly, and follows through.  You may be thinking, how hard could that be? You'll see when you try it.

That can be useful in cases where you can't or don't want to figure out what the valuation should be.  You leave it to the next investor.

I talked to a VC recently who said he'd met with a company he really liked, but he turned them down because investors already owned more than half of it. Those investors probably thought they'd been pretty clever by getting such a large chunk of this desirable company, but in fact they were shooting themselves in the foot."}]}

We now know the answer: computers.  It's clear now that even by using the word \"convergence\" we were giving TV too much credit.  This won't be convergence so much as replacement. People may still watch things they call \"TV shows,\" but they'll watch them mostly on computers."}]}

The average teenage kid has a pretty much infinite capacity for talking to their friends.  But they can't physically be with them all the time.  When I was in high school the solution was the telephone.  Now it's social networks, multiplayer games, and various messaging applications.  The way you reach them all is through a computer."}]}

But they're still dragging their heels.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How is the rise of the Internet impacting traditional broadcast media, particularly local television?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whether they like it or not, big changes are coming, because the Internet dissolves the two cornerstones of broadcast media: synchronicity and locality.  On the Internet, you don't have to send everyone the same signal, and you don't have to send it to them from a local source.  People will watch what they want when they want it, and group themselves according to whatever shared interest they feel most strongly.  Maybe their strongest shared interest will be their physical location, but I'm guessing not. Which means local TV is probably dead.  It was an artifact of limitations imposed by old technology.  If someone were creating an Internet-based TV company from scratch now, they might have some plan for shows aimed at specific regions, but it wouldn't be a top priority."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do synchronicity and locality impact viewer behavior for local TV news?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Synchronicity and locality are tied together.  TV network affiliates care what's on at 10 because that delivers viewers for local news at 11.  This connection adds more brittleness than strength, however: people don't watch what's on at 10 because they want to watch the news afterward."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are TV networks struggling to adapt to changing trends in the industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TV networks will fight these trends, because they don't have sufficient flexibility to adapt to them.  They're hemmed in by local affiliates in much the same way car companies are hemmed in by dealers and unions.  Inevitably, the people running the networks will take the easy route and try to keep the old model running for a couple more years, just as the record labels have done."}]}

Instead of delivering what viewers want, they're trying to force them to change their habits to suit the networks' obsolete business model.  That never works unless you have a monopoly or cartel to enforce it, and even then it only works temporarily."}]}

That's what a lot of Internet startups are, though they may not have had this as an explicit goal.  People only have so many leisure hours a day, and TV is premised on such long sessions (unlike Google, which prides itself on sending users on their way quickly) that anything that takes up their time is competing with it.  But in addition to such indirect competitors, I think TV companies will increasingly face direct ones."}]}

The networks used to be gatekeepers. They distributed your work, and sold advertising on it.  Now the people who produce a show can distribute it themselves.

On the Internet there's no reason to keep their current format, or even the fact that they have a single format.  Indeed, the more interesting sort of convergence that's coming is between shows and games.  But on the question of what sort of entertainment gets distributed on the Internet in 20 years, I wouldn't dare to make any predictions, except that things will change a lot.

They assumed that their local network infrastructure would be critical to do video on-demand, because you couldn't possibly stream it from a few data centers over the internet.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are effective strategies for encouraging startups to stay in a city?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you want to encourage startups in a particular city, you have to fund startups that won't leave.  There are two ways to do that: have rules preventing them from leaving, or fund them at the point in their life when they naturally take root.  The first approach is a mistake, because it becomes a filter for selecting bad startups. If your terms force startups to do things they don't want to, only the desperate ones will take your money."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies can cities use to retain startups and prevent them from relocating for funding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good startups will move to another city as a condition of funding.

If you want to keep startups from leaving your town, you have to give them enough that they're not tempted by an offer from Silicon Valley VCs that requires them to move.

Suppose to be on the safe side it would cost a million dollars per startup. If you could get startups to stick to your town for a million apiece, then for a billion dollars you could bring in a thousand startups.

You could probably do it in five years.  During the term of one mayor. And it would get easier over time, because the more startups you had in town, the less it would take to get new ones to move there. By the time you had a thousand startups in town, the VCs wouldn't be trying so hard to get them to move to Silicon Valley; instead they'd be opening local offices.  Then you'd really be in good shape.  You'd have started a self-sustaining chain reaction like the one that drives the Valley."}]}

But unfortunately you run into a chicken and egg problem here.  If your city isn't already a startup hub, there won't be people there who got rich from startups. And there is no way I can think of that a city could attract angels from outside. By definition they're rich.  There's no incentive that would make them move."}]}

In principle they're entitled to, but how would they choose valuations for the startups?  You couldn't just give them all the same valuation: that would be too low for some (who'd turn you down) and too high for others (because it might make their next round a \"down round\"). And since we're assuming we're doing this without being able to pick startups, we also have to assume we can't value them, since that's practically the same thing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential reputational risks associated with investing in startups compared to established companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another reason not to take stock in the startups is that startups are often involved in disreputable things.  So are established companies, but they don't get blamed for it.  If someone gets murdered by someone they met on Facebook, the press will treat the story as if it were about Facebook.  If someone gets murdered by someone they met at a supermarket, the press will just treat it as a story about a murder.  So understand that if you invest in startups, they might build things that get used for pornography, or file-sharing, or the expression of unfashionable opinions.  You should probably sponsor this project jointly with your political opponents, so they can't use whatever the startups do as a club to beat you with."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the broken windows theory relate to the behavior of online communities, as illustrated by changes in Reddit?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's pretty clear now that the broken windows theory applies to community sites as well.  The theory is that minor forms of bad behavior encourage worse ones: that a neighborhood with lots of graffiti and broken windows becomes one where robberies occur.  I was living in New York when Giuliani introduced the reforms that made the broken windows theory famous, and the transformation was miraculous. And I was a Reddit user when the opposite happened there, and the transformation was equally dramatic."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the key factors that contributed to Reddit's rapid growth compared to Hacker News?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not criticizing Steve and Alexis.  What happened to Reddit didn't happen out of neglect.  From the start they had a policy of censoring nothing except spam.  Plus Reddit had different goals from Hacker News.  Reddit was a startup, not a side project; its goal was to grow as fast as possible.  Combine rapid growth and zero censorship, and the result is a free for all.  But I don't think they'd do much differently if they were doing it again. Measured by traffic, Reddit is much more successful than Hacker News."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do user behaviors on online platforms like HN differ based on the community dynamics compared to Reddit?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But what happened to Reddit won't inevitably happen to HN. There are several local maxima.  There can be places that are free for alls and places that are more thoughtful, just as there are in the real world; and people will behave differently depending on which they're in, just as they do in the real world."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies do some users employ when sharing content on different online platforms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've observed this in the wild.  I've seen people cross-posting on Reddit and Hacker News who actually took the trouble to write two versions, a flame for Reddit and a more subdued version for HN."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What types of problems does Hacker News aim to prevent in its community?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two major types of problems a site like Hacker News needs to avoid: bad stories and bad comments.  So far the danger of bad stories seems smaller.  The stories on the frontpage now are still roughly the ones that would have been there when HN started."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the quality of content on the frontpage of a voting platform?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I once thought I'd have to weight votes to keep crap off the frontpage, but I haven't had to yet.  I wouldn't have predicted the frontpage would hold up so well, and I'm not sure why it has. Perhaps only the more thoughtful users care enough to submit and upvote links, so the marginal cost of one random new user approaches zero.  Or perhaps the frontpage protects itself, by advertising what type of submission is expected."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the quality of content that gets upvoted on the frontpage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most dangerous thing for the frontpage is stuff that's too easy to upvote.  If someone proves a new theorem, it takes some work by the reader to decide whether or not to upvote it.  An amusing cartoon takes less.  A rant with a rallying cry as the title takes zero, because people vote it up without even reading it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the Fluff Principle in the context of user-voted news sites?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hence what I call the Fluff Principle: on a user-voted news site, the links that are easiest to judge will take over unless you take specific measures to prevent it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What measures does Hacker News implement to minimize off-topic content?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hacker News has two kinds of protections against fluff.  The most common types of fluff links are banned as off-topic.  Pictures of kittens, political diatribes, and so on are explicitly banned.  This keeps out most fluff, but not all of it.  Some links are both fluff, in the sense of being very short, and also on topic."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria do editors use to evaluate and manage content on a platform related to hacking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's no single solution to that.  If a link is just an empty rant, editors will sometimes kill it even if it's on topic in the sense of being about hacking, because it's not on topic by the real standard, which is to engage one's intellectual curiosity.  If the posts on a site are characteristically of this type I sometimes ban it, which means new stuff at that url is auto-killed.  If a post has a linkbait title, editors sometimes rephrase it to be more matter-of-fact.  This is especially necessary with links whose titles are rallying cries, because otherwise they become implicit \"vote up if you believe such-and-such\" posts, which are the most extreme form of fluff."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How have aggregators influenced the way writers create content online?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The techniques for dealing with links have to evolve, because the links do. The existence of aggregators has already affected what they aggregate. Writers now deliberately write things to draw traffic from aggregators—sometimes even specific ones.  (No, the irony of this statement is not lost on me.)  Then there are the more sinister mutations, like linkjacking—posting a paraphrase of someone else's article and submitting that instead of the original. These can get a lot of upvotes, because a lot of what's good in an article often survives; indeed, the closer the paraphrase is to plagiarism, the more survives."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can users of a submission-based site ensure transparency regarding rejected submissions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's important that a site that kills submissions provide a way for users to see what got killed if they want to.  That keeps editors honest, and just as importantly, makes users confident they'd know if the editors stopped being honest. HN users can do this by flipping a switch called showdead in their profile."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges does Hacker News face regarding user-generated content?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bad comments seem to be a harder problem than bad submissions. While the quality of links on the frontpage of HN hasn't changed much, the quality of the median comment may have decreased somewhat."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two main types of negative comments, and how can they be addressed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two main kinds of badness in comments: meanness and stupidity.  There is a lot of overlap between the two—mean comments are disproportionately likely also to be dumb—but the strategies for dealing with them are different.  Meanness is easier to control.  You can have rules saying one shouldn't be mean, and if you enforce them it seems possible to keep a lid on meanness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it more challenging to manage or control stupidity compared to meanness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keeping a lid on stupidity is harder, perhaps because stupidity is not so easily distinguishable.  Mean people are more likely to know they're being mean than stupid people are to know they're being stupid."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of comment is considered most harmful in online discussions, and why?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most dangerous form of stupid comment is not the long but mistaken argument, but the dumb joke.  Long but mistaken arguments are actually quite rare.  There is a strong correlation between comment quality and length; if you wanted to compare the quality of comments on community sites, average length would be a good predictor.  Probably the cause is human nature rather than anything specific to comment threads. Probably it's simply that stupidity more often takes the form of having few ideas than wrong ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common characteristic of stupid comments and how do people try to make them stand out?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whatever the cause, stupid comments tend to be short.  And since it's hard to write a short comment that's distinguished for the amount of information it conveys, people try to distinguish them instead by being funny.  The most tempting format for stupid comments is the supposedly witty put-down, probably because put-downs are the easiest form of humor."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do negative comments influence the quality of subsequent discussions in online forums?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bad comments are like kudzu: they take over rapidly. Comments have much more effect on new comments than submissions have on new submissions.  If someone submits a lame article, the other submissions don't all become lame.  But if someone posts a stupid comment on a thread, that sets the tone for the region around it.  People reply to dumb jokes with dumb jokes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can we improve the quality of online discussions and reduce the prevalence of low-quality comments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe the solution is to add a delay before people can respond to a comment, and make the length of the delay inversely proportional to some prediction of its quality.  Then dumb threads would grow slower."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary focus of the techniques described for managing online communities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I notice most of the techniques I've described are conservative: they're aimed at preserving the character of the site rather than enhancing it.  I don't think that's a bias of mine.  It's due to the shape of the problem.  Hacker News had the good fortune to start out good, so in this case it's literally a matter of preservation. But I think this principle would also apply to sites with different origins."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is more important for the quality of a community site, the users or the technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The good things in a community site come from people more than technology; it's mainly in the prevention of bad things that technology comes into play. Technology certainly can enhance discussion.  Nested comments do, for example.  But I'd rather use a site with primitive features and smart, nice users than a more advanced one whose users were idiots or"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies can a community site implement to attract and retain a specific subset of users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So the most important thing a community site can do is attract the kind of people it wants.  A site trying to be as big as possible wants to attract everyone.  But a site aiming at a particular subset of users has to attract just those—and just as importantly, repel everyone else.  I've made a conscious effort to do this on HN.  The graphic design is as plain as possible, and the site rules discourage dramatic link titles.  The goal is that the only thing to interest someone arriving at HN for the first time should be the ideas expressed there."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential drawbacks of designing a website to appeal specifically to a target audience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The downside of tuning a site to attract certain people is that, to those people, it can be too attractive.  I'm all too aware how addictive Hacker News can be.  For me, as for many users, it's a kind of virtual town square.  When I want to take a break from working, I walk into the square, just as I might into Harvard Square or University Ave in the physical world."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why can online distractions be more harmful than physical ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But an online square is more dangerous than a physical one.  If I spent half the day loitering on University Ave, I'd notice.  I have to walk a mile to get there, and sitting in a cafe feels different from working. But visiting an online forum takes just a click, and feels superficially very much like working.  You may be wasting your time, but you're not idle.  Someone is"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential downsides of using Hacker News despite its usefulness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hacker News is definitely useful.  I've learned a lot from things I've read on HN.  I've written several essays that began as comments there.  So I wouldn't want the site to go away.  But I would like to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity.  What a disaster that would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site that caused them to waste lots of time.  I wish I could be 100% sure that's not a description of HN."}]}

The situation now is like it was with crack in the 1980s: we've invented terribly addictive new things, and we haven't yet evolved ways to protect ourselves from them.  We will eventually, and that's one of the problems I hope to focus on next."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What methods were used to evaluate the effectiveness of user comment scores in determining quality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I tried ranking users by both average and median comment score, and average (with the high score thrown out) seemed the more accurate predictor of high quality.  Median may be the more accurate predictor of low quality though."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What lesson can be drawn about accuracy in distinguishing between individuals in an experiment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another thing I learned from this experiment is that if you're going to distinguish between people, you better be sure you do it right.  This is one problem where rapid prototyping doesn't work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to avoid discrimination among different types of people?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, that's the intellectually honest argument for not discriminating between various types of people.  The reason not to do it is not that everyone's the same, but that it's bad to do wrong and hard to do right."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the reason for the lack of transparency in Digg's frontpage algorithm compared to Reddit's?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Digg is notorious for its lack of transparency.  The root of the problem is not that the guys running Digg are especially sneaky, but that they use the wrong algorithm for generating their frontpage. Instead of bubbling up from the bottom as they get more votes, as on Reddit, stories start at the top and get pushed down by new arrivals."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the origins of Digg and Reddit, and how do they differ in their design and functionality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason for the difference is that Digg is derived from Slashdot, while Reddit is derived from Delicious/popular.  Digg is Slashdot with voting instead of editors, and Reddit is Delicious/popular with voting instead of bookmarking.  (You can still see fossils of their origins in their graphic design.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Digg's algorithm and editorial decisions influence the selection of top stories on the platform?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Digg's algorithm is very vulnerable to gaming, because any story that makes it onto the frontpage is the new top story.  Which in turn forces Digg to respond with extreme countermeasures.  A lot of startups have some kind of secret about the subterfuges they had to resort to in the early days, and I suspect Digg's is the extent to which the top stories were de facto chosen by human editors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What innovative strategies can be used to reduce repetitive or unproductive comments in online discussions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I suspect most of the techniques for discouraging stupid comments have yet to be discovered.  Xkcd implemented a particularly clever one in its IRC channel: don't allow the same thing twice. Once someone has said \"fail,\" no one can ever say it again.  This would penalize short comments especially, because they have less room to avoid collisions in."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a potential solution for managing negative comments in online discussions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You may not have to kill bad comments to solve the problem.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to religious discussions on online forums often turning into arguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As a rule, any mention of religion on an online forum degenerates into a religious argument.  Why?  Why does this happen with religion and not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk about on forums?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do discussions about religion tend to attract more participation than technical discussions, like those about Javascript?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What's different about religion is that people don't feel they need to have any particular expertise to have opinions about it.  All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can have those.  No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one about religion, because people feel they have to be over some threshold of expertise to post comments about that.  But on religion everyone's an expert."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What parallels can be drawn between politics and religion regarding the expression of opinions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too.  Politics, like religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertise for expressing an opinion.  All you need is strong convictions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What commonality exists between religion and politics in terms of how they influence people's opinions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Do religion and politics have something in common that explains this similarity?  One possible explanation is that they deal with questions that have no definite answers, so there's no back pressure on people's opinions.  Since no one can be proven wrong, every opinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly with theirs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the nature of answers to political questions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But this isn't true.  There are certainly some political questions that have definite answers, like how much a new government policy will cost.  But the more precise political questions suffer the same fate as the vaguer ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do religion and politics influence personal identity and affect discussions surrounding them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think what religion and politics have in common is that they become part of people's identity, and people can never have a fruitful argument about something that's part of their identity. By definition they're partisan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence whether a discussion about historical events becomes contentious?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Which topics engage people's identity depends on the people, not the topic.  For example, a discussion about a battle that included citizens of one or more of the countries involved would probably degenerate into a political argument.  But a discussion today about a battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn't.  No one would know what side to be on.  So it's not politics that's the source of the trouble, but identity.  When people say a discussion has degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that it has started to be driven mostly by people's identities."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it a mistake to assume that certain questions have no answer due to the passionate debates they provoke?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because the point at which this happens depends on the people rather than the topic, it's a mistake to conclude that because a question tends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer. For example, the question of the relative merits of programming languages often degenerates into a religious war, because so many programmers identify as X programmers or Y programmers.  This sometimes leads people to conclude the question must be unanswerable—that all languages are equally good.  Obviously that's false: anything else people make can be well or badly designed; why should this be uniquely impossible for programming languages?  And indeed, you can have a fruitful discussion about the relative merits of programming languages, so long as you exclude people who respond from identity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors determine whether a discussion on a particular topic can be productive?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "More generally, you can have a fruitful discussion about a topic only if it doesn't engage the identities of any of the participants.  What makes politics and religion such minefields is that they engage so many people's identities.  But you could in principle have a useful conversation about them with some people. And there are other topics that might seem harmless, like the relative merits of Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, that you couldn't safely talk about with"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can minimizing personal identity influences lead to improved idea generation and clearer thinking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it's right, is that it explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but how to have better ideas.  If people can't think clearly about anything that has become part of their identity, then all other things being equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the impact of self-labeling on personal growth and tolerance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant.  But there is a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y: not even to consider yourself an x.  The more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What effect does a sudden influx of participants in a discussion have on the nature of the conversation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When that happens, it tends to happen fast, like a core going critical.

For example, being a scientist.  But arguably that is more of a placeholder than an actual label—like putting NMI on a form that asks for your middle initial—because it doesn't commit you to believing anything in particular.   A scientist isn't committed to believing in natural selection in the same way a biblical literalist is committed to rejecting it.  All he's committed to is following the evidence wherever it leads."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean to consider oneself a scientist in terms of knowledge and inquiry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Considering yourself a scientist is equivalent to putting a sign in a cupboard saying \"this cupboard must be kept empty.\"  Yes, strictly speaking, you're putting something in the cupboard, but not in the ordinary sense."}]}

But though wealth was a necessary condition for passing, it was not a sufficient one.  By the standards of the rest of the world in 587, the Chinese system was very enlightened.  Europeans didn't introduce formal civil service exams till the nineteenth century, and even then they seem to have been influenced by the Chinese example."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of using performance-based testing for government positions compared to previous methods of obtaining such positions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Before credentials, government positions were obtained mainly by family influence, if not outright bribery.   It was a great step forward to judge people by their performance on a test.  But by no means a perfect solution.  When you judge people that way, you tend to get cram schools—which they did in Ming China and nineteenth century England just as much as in present day South Korea."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do cram schools influence the transfer of power and wealth between generations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What cram schools are, in effect, is leaks in a seal.

Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into credentials in the next."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between standardized testing and the evolution of educational institutions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's hard to beat this phenomenon, because the schools adjust to suit whatever the tests measure.  When the tests are narrow and predictable, you get cram schools on the classic model, like those that prepared candidates for Sandhurst (the British West Point) or the classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores. But as the tests get broader, the schools do too.  Preparing a candidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years, as prep school does today.

It's a fine thing for parents to help their children indirectly—for example, by helping them to become smarter or more disciplined, which then makes them more successful.  The problem comes when parents use direct methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or power as a substitute for their children's qualities."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What actions are parents likely to take for the benefit of their children, even if it challenges their moral values?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Parents will tend to do this when they can.

If the tests a society uses are currently hackable, we can study the way people beat them and try to plug the holes.  You can use the cram schools to show you where most of the holes are.

In the US this process still shows many outward signs of corruption.  For example, legacy admissions.  The official story is that legacy status doesn't carry much weight, because all it does is break ties: applicants are bucketed by ability, and legacy status is only used to decide between the applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff.  But what this means is that a university can make legacy status have as much or as little weight as they want, by adjusting the size of the bucket that straddles the cutoff."}]}

Why haven't we just been measuring actual performance?  Think about where credentialism first appeared: in selecting candidates for large organizations.  Individual performance is hard to measure in large organizations, and the harder performance is to measure, the more important it is to predict it.  If an organization could immediately and cheaply measure the performance of recruits, they wouldn't need to examine their credentials.  They could take everyone and keep just the good ones."}]}

But a bunch of small organizations in a market can come close.  A market takes every organization and keeps just the good ones.  As organizations get smaller, this approaches taking every person and keeping just the good ones.  So all other things being equal, a society consisting of more, smaller organizations will care less about credentials."}]}

That's why those quotes from Korea sound so old fashioned.  They're talking about an economy like America's a few decades ago, dominated by a few big companies. The route for the ambitious in that sort of environment is to join one and climb to the top.  Credentials matter a lot then.  In the culture of a large organization, an elite pedigree becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might impressive credentials be less valued in small companies compared to larger organizations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This doesn't work in small companies.  Even if your colleagues were impressed by your credentials, they'd soon be parted from you if your performance didn't match, because the company would go out of business and the people would be dispersed."}]}

People hiring for a startup don't care whether you've even graduated from college, let alone which one.  All they care about is what you can do.  Which is in fact all that should matter, even in a large organization.  The reason credentials have such prestige is that for so long the large organizations in a society tended to be the most powerful.  But in the US at least they don't have the monopoly on power they once did, precisely because they can't measure (and thus reward) individual performance. Why spend twenty years climbing the corporate ladder when you can get rewarded directly by the market?"}]}

I'm an agent of the change I'm seeing.  But I don't think I'm imagining it.  It was not so easy 25 years ago for an ambitious person to choose to be judged directly by the market.

My friend Julian Weber told me that when he went to work for a New York law firm in the 1950s they paid associates far less than firms do today.  Law firms then made no pretense of paying people according to the value of the work they'd done.  Pay was based on seniority.  The younger employees were paying their dues.

The other is that some companies broke ranks and started to pay young employees large amounts.  This was particularly true in consulting, law, and finance, where it led to the phenomenon of yuppies.

I don't think there was a causal connection.  Startups happened because technology started to change so fast that big companies could no longer keep a lid on the smaller ones.  I don't think the rise of yuppies was inspired by it; it seems more as if there was a change in the social conventions (and perhaps the laws) governing the way big companies worked.

Measurement spreads like heat.  If one part of a society is better at measurement than others, it tends to push the others to do better.  If people who are young but smart and driven can make more by starting their own companies than by working for existing ones, the existing companies are forced to pay more to keep them.  So market rates gradually permeate every organization, even the government."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors have contributed to the decreased reliance of startups on venture capital funding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason startups no longer depend so much on VCs is one that everyone in the startup business knows by now: it has gotten much cheaper to start a startup.  There are four main reasons: Moore's law has made hardware cheap; open source has made software free; the web has made marketing and distribution free; and more powerful programming languages mean development teams can be smaller.  These changes have pushed the cost of starting a startup down into the noise.  In a lot of startups—probaby most startups funded by Y Combinator—the biggest expense is simply the founders' living expenses.

For example, though the stock market crash does seem to have made investors more cautious, it doesn't seem to have had any effect on the number of people who want to start startups.  We take applications for funding every 6 months.

That's different from the way things felt in 2001.  Then there was a widespread feeling among potential founders that startups were over, and that one should just go to grad school.   That isn't happening this time, and part of the reason is that even in a bad economy it's not that hard to build something that makes $3000 a month.  If investors stop writing checks, who cares?"}]}

They all know one another, and techniques spread rapidly between them. If one tries a new programming language or a new hosting provider and gets good results, 6 months later half of them are using it. And the same is true for funding.

An ambitious kid graduating from college in 1960 wanted to work in the huge, gleaming offices of Ford, or General Electric, or NASA.  Small meant small-time.

But till recently this was an anomalous route that tended to be followed only by outsiders.  It was no coincidence that the great industrialists of the nineteenth century had so little formal education.  As huge as their companies eventually became, they were all essentially mechanics and shopkeepers at first.  That was a social step no one with a college education would take if they could avoid it.

Two new kinds of techniques were developed there: techniques for building integrated circuits, and techniques for building a new type of company designed to grow fast by creating new technology.  The techniques for building integrated circuits spread rapidly to other countries.  But the techniques for building startups didn't.  Fifty years later, startups are ubiquitous in Silicon Valley and common in a handful of other US cities, but they're still an anomaly in most of the world."}]}

Though it brought many social changes, the Industrial Revolution was not fighting the principle that bigger is better.  Quite the opposite: the two dovetailed beautifully. The new industrial companies adapted the customs of existing large organizations like the military and the civil service, and the resulting hybrid worked well.  \"Captains of industry\" issued orders to \"armies of workers,\" and everyone knew what they were supposed to do."}]}

There's obviously the direct cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and check proofs of the supplier's solvency.  But the real costs are the ones you never hear about: the company that would be the best supplier, but doesn't bid because they can't spare the effort to get verified.

Joel Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software to corporate customers.  He said that in most companies software costing up to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers without any additional approvals.  Above that threshold, software purchases generally had to be approved by a committee.  But babysitting this process was so expensive for software vendors that it didn't make sense to charge less than $50,000.

And not merely linearly, either.  If you're hard enough to sell to, the people who are best at making things don't want to bother.

But checks instituted by governments can cause much worse problems than merely overpaying.  Checks instituted by governments can cripple a country's whole economy.  Up till about 1400, China was richer and more technologically advanced than Europe. One reason Europe pulled ahead was that the Chinese government restricted long trading voyages.  So it was left to the Europeans to explore and eventually to dominate the rest of the world, including China."}]}

That wasn't the intention of the legislators who wrote it.  They just wanted to add a few more checks on public companies.  But they forgot to consider the cost.  They forgot that companies about to go public are usually rather stretched, and that the weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for General Electric to bear are enough to prevent younger companies from being public at all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some key considerations organizations should evaluate regarding the cost of checks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Once you start to think about the cost of checks, you can start to ask other interesting questions. Is the cost increasing or decreasing? Is it higher in some areas than others?  Where does it increase discontinuously?  If large organizations started to ask questions like that, they'd learn some frightening things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might the rising importance of software in companies affect the cost of checks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think the cost of checks may actually be increasing.

In true startups, there are no external checks at all.  If you have an idea for a new feature in the morning, you can write it and push it to the production servers before lunch.  And when you can do that, you have more ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do programmers face when transitioning from a startup to a big company regarding software release timelines?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At big companies, software has to go through various approvals before it can be launched.  And the cost of doing this can be enormous—in fact, discontinuous.  I was talking recently to a group of three programmers whose startup had been acquired a few years before by a big company.  When they'd been independent, they could release changes instantly.  Now, they said, the absolute fastest they could get code released on the production servers was two weeks."}]}

Then I asked what was the maximum percentage of the acquisition price they'd trade for it.  They said they didn't want to think about it, because they didn't want to know how high they'd go, but I got the impression it might be as much as half."}]}

And you know what?  It would have been perfectly safe to let them.  In fact, the acquirer would have been better off; not only wouldn't these guys have broken anything, they'd have gotten a lot more done. So the acquirer is in fact getting worse performance at greater cost.  Just like the committee approving software purchases."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key challenge of relying on your business revenues for personal income?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One disadvantage of living off the revenues of your company is that you have to keep running it.

You can't just start a business and check out once things are going well, or they stop going well surprisingly fast."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the primary economic motivations of startup founders, and how do these motivations contrast with the realities of running a business?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main economic motives of startup founders seem to be freedom and security.  They want enough money that (a) they don't have to worry about running out of money and (b) they can spend their time how they want.  Running your own business offers neither.  You certainly don't have freedom: no boss is so demanding.  Nor do you have security, because if you stop paying attention to the company, its revenues go away, and with them your income."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential benefits of hiring a manager for a growing business?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best case, for most people, would be if you could hire someone to manage the company for you once you'd grown it to a certain size. Suppose you could find a really good manager.  Then you would have both freedom and security.  You could pay as little attention to the business as you wanted, knowing that your manager would keep things running smoothly.  And that being so, revenues would continue to flow in, so you'd have security as well."}]}

Some will do everything, from finding tenants to fixing leaks.  Of course, running companies is a lot more complicated than managing rental property, but let's suppose there were management companies that could do it for you. They'd charge a lot, but wouldn't it be worth it?  I'd sacrifice a large percentage of the income for the extra peace of mind."}]}

If company management companies existed, there would be an additional service they could offer clients: they could let them insure their returns by pooling their risk.  After all, even a perfect manager can't save a company when, as sometimes happens, its whole market dies, just as property managers can't save you from the building burning down.  But a company that managed a large enough number of companies could say to all its clients: we'll combine the revenues from all your companies, and pay you your proportionate share."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What benefits would management companies provide to business owners?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If such management companies existed, they'd offer the maximum of freedom and security.

The simplest way would be to have a new kind of stock representing the total pool of companies they were managing.  When you signed up, you'd trade your company's stock for shares of this pool, in proportion to an estimate of your company's value that you'd both agreed upon.  Then you'd automatically get your share of the returns of the whole pool."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How could management companies enable clients to change their investment strategies more flexibly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The catch is that because this kind of trade would be hard to undo, you couldn't switch management companies.  But there's a way they could fix that: suppose all the company management companies got together and agreed to allow their clients to exchange shares in all their pools.  Then you could, in effect, simultaneously choose all the management companies to run yours for you, in whatever proportion you wanted, and change your mind later as often as you wanted."}]}

With a property management company, you can just walk in whenever you want and say \"manage my rental property for me\" and they'll do it.  Whereas acquirers are, as of this writing, extremely fickle.  Sometimes they're in a buying mood and they'll overpay enormously; other times they're not interested. They're like property management companies run by madmen.  Or more precisely, by Benjamin Graham's Mr. Market."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence the performance of public acquirers over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So while on average public acquirers behave like pooled-risk company managers, you need a window of several years to get average case performance.

And yet some of the most successful startups, including Google, ignored revenue at first and concentrated exclusively on development.  The answer probably depends on the type of company you're starting.  I can imagine some where trying to make sales would be a good heuristic for product design, and others where it would just be a distraction.  The test is probably whether it helps you to understand your users."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of profitability in determining a revenue strategy for a new company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can choose whichever revenue strategy you think is best for the type of company you're starting, so long as you're profitable.

Power matters in New York too of course, but New York is pretty impressed by a billion dollars even if you merely inherited it.  In Silicon Valley no one would care except a few real estate agents.  What matters in Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world.

Empirically, the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you had enough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be able to transcend your environment.

But when I finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not to be.  The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better.  Life in Berkeley is very civilized.

Cambridge with good weather, it turns out, is not Cambridge. The people you find in Cambridge are not there by accident.  You have to make sacrifices to live there.  It's expensive and somewhat grubby, and the weather's often bad.  So the kind of people you find in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where the smartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive, grubby place with bad weather."}]}

I realize that seems a preposterous claim.  What makes it true is that it's more preposterous to claim about anywhere else.  American universities currently seem to be the best, judging from the flow of ambitious students.  And what US city has a stronger claim?  New York?  A fair number of smart people, but diluted by a much larger number of neanderthals in suits.  The Bay Area has a lot of smart people too, but again, diluted;  there are two great universities, but they're far apart.

For a long time cities were the only large collections of people, so you could use the two ideas interchangeably.  But we can see how much things are changing from the examples I've mentioned.  New York is a classic great city. But Cambridge is just part of a city, and Silicon Valley is not even that.  (San Jose is not, as it sometimes claims, the capital of Silicon Valley.

When you walk through Palo Alto in the evening, you see nothing but the blue glow of TVs.  In Cambridge you see shelves full of promising-looking books.

It's not something you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off.

In America only a few rich people buy original art, and even the more sophisticated ones rarely get past judging it by the brand name of the artist.

I'm not sure why — probably some combination of the increasing power of women, the increasing influence of actors as models, and the fact that so many people work in offices now: you can't show off by wearing clothes too fancy to wear in a factory, so you have to show off with your body instead."}]}

Or wouldn't you?  What it means is to know what's what. So maybe it has simply replaced the component of social class that consisted of being \"au fait.\"  That could explain why hipness seems particularly admired in London: it's version 2 of the traditional English delight in obscure codes that only insiders understand."}]}

It used to mean the control of vast human and material resources.  But increasingly it means the ability to direct the course of technology, and some of the people in a position to do that are not even rich — leaders of important open source projects, for example.  The Captains of Industry of times past had laboratories full of clever people cooking up new technologies for them.  The new breed are themselves those people."}]}

In these the best practitioners aren't conveniently collected in a few top university departments and research labs — partly because talent is harder to judge, and partly because people pay for these things, so one doesn't need to rely on teaching or research funding to support oneself.  It's in these more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city: you need the encouragement of feeling that people around you care about the kind of work you do, and since you have to find peers for yourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a great city."}]}

In past times people lied to kids about some things more than we do now, but the lies implicit in an artificial, protected environment are a recent invention.

So what's going on?  There does seem to be a universal taboo against sex with prepubescent children.  One can imagine evolutionary reasons for that.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the reasons parents give for prohibiting their children from swearing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've never heard more different explanations for anything parents tell kids than why they shouldn't swear.  Every parent I know forbids their children to swear, and yet no two of them have the same justification.  It's clear most start with not wanting kids to swear, then make up the reason afterward."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do swearwords play in distinguishing adult speech from that of children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "of swearwords is to mark the speaker as an adult.  There's no difference in the meaning of \"shit\" and \"poopoo.\"  So why should one be ok for kids to say and one forbidden?  The only explanation is: by definition."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What concerns do adults have about children engaging in adult behaviors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why does it bother adults so much when kids do things reserved for adults?   The idea of a foul-mouthed, cynical 10 year old leaning against a lamppost with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth is very disconcerting.  But why?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do parents often find it appealing to preserve the innocence and mispronunciations of their young children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason we want kids to be innocent is that we're programmed to like certain kinds of helplessness.  I've several times heard mothers say they deliberately refrained from correcting their young children's mispronunciations because they were so cute.  And if you think about it, cuteness is helplessness. Toys and cartoon characters meant to be cute always have clueless expressions and stubby, ineffectual limbs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for children to retain a sense of wonder and openness as they grow?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not surprising we'd have an inborn desire to love and protect helpless creatures, considering human offspring are so helpless for so long.  Without the helplessness that makes kids cute, they'd be very annoying.  They'd merely seem like incompetent adults.  But there's more to it than that.  The reason our hypothetical jaded 10 year old bothers me so much is not just that he'd be annoying, but that he'd have cut off his prospects for growth so early.  To be jaded you have to think you know how the world works, and any theory a 10 year old had about that would probably be a pretty narrow one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for children to maintain a sense of innocence as they learn about the world?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Innocence is also open-mindedness.  We want kids to be innocent so they can continue to learn.  Paradoxical as it sounds, there are some kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds of knowledge.  If you're going to learn that the world is a brutal place full of people trying to take advantage of one another, you're better off learning it last.  Otherwise you won't bother learning much more."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might some highly intelligent adults choose to remain unaware of certain knowledge?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Very smart adults often seem unusually innocent, and I don't think this is a coincidence.  I think they've deliberately avoided learning about certain things.  Certainly I do.  I used to think I wanted to know everything.  Now I know I don't."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do adults often avoid discussing the topic of death with children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "After sex, death is the topic adults lie most conspicuously about to kids.  Sex I believe they conceal because of deep taboos.  But why do we conceal death from kids?   Probably because small children are particularly horrified by it.  They want to feel safe, and death is the ultimate threat."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What elaborate story did the narrator's parents create about the death of their first cat?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most spectacular lies our parents told us was about the death of our first cat.  Over the years, as we asked for more details, they were compelled to invent more, so the story grew quite elaborate.  The cat had died at the vet's office.  Of what?  Of the anaesthesia itself.  Why was the cat at the vet's office?  To be fixed.  And why had such a routine operation killed it?  It wasn't the vet's fault; the cat had a congenitally weak heart; the anaesthesia was too much for it; but there was no way anyone could have known this in advance.  It was not till we were in our twenties that the truth came out: my sister, then about three, had accidentally stepped on the cat and broken its back."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the author's parents approach discussions about death and the afterlife with their children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They didn't feel the need to tell us the cat was now happily in cat heaven.  My parents never claimed that people or animals who died had \"gone to a better place,\" or that we'd meet them again.  It didn't seem to harm us."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the experience of the narrator's grandmother on the day of the grandfather's death?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My grandmother told us an edited version of the death of my grandfather.  She said they'd been sitting reading one day, and when she said something to him, he didn't answer.  He seemed to be asleep, but when she tried to rouse him, she couldn't.  \"He was gone.\" Having a heart attack sounded like falling asleep.  Later I learned it hadn't been so neat, and the heart attack had taken most of a day to kill him."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the way parents handle conversations about death affect a child's understanding of mortality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Along with such outright lies, there must have been a lot of changing the subject when death came up.  I can't remember that, of course, but I can infer it from the fact that I didn't really grasp I was going to die till I was about 19.  How could I have missed something so obvious for so long?  Now that I've seen parents managing the subject, I can see how: questions about death are gently but firmly turned aside."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do children often prefer to believe comforting falsehoods about their world?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "On this topic, especially, they're met half-way by kids.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do parents face when trying to instill ethnic or religious identity in their children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some parents feel a strong adherence to an ethnic or religious group and want their kids to feel it too.  This usually requires two different kinds of lying: the first is to tell the child that he or she is an X, and the second is whatever specific lies Xes differentiate themselves by believing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact does labeling a child's ethnic or religious identity have on their personal development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Telling a child they have a particular ethnic or religious identity is one of the stickiest things you can tell them.  Almost anything else you tell a kid, they can change their mind about later when they start to think for themselves.  But if you tell a kid they're a member of a certain group, that seems nearly impossible to shake."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do parents' religious choices influence their children's identity formation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This despite the fact that it can be one of the most premeditated lies parents tell.  When parents are of different religions, they'll often agree between themselves that their children will be \"raised as Xes.\"  And it works. The kids obligingly grow up considering themselves as Xes, despite the fact that if their parents had chosen the other way, they'd have grown up considering themselves as Ys."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological factors contribute to individuals' strong identification with a group characterized by arbitrary beliefs and customs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason this works so well is the second kind of lie involved. The truth is common property.  You can't distinguish your group by doing things that are rational, and believing things that are true. If you want to set yourself apart from other people, you have to do things that are arbitrary, and believe things that are false. And after having spent their whole lives doing things that are arbitrary and believing things that are false, and being regarded as odd by \"outsiders\" on that account, the cognitive dissonance pushing children to regard themselves as Xes must be enormous.  If they aren't an X, why are they attached to all these arbitrary beliefs and customs?  If they aren't an X, why do all the non-Xes call them one?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential benefits of instilling specific beliefs in children as part of their identity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This form of lie is not without its uses.  You can use it to carry a payload of beneficial beliefs, and they will also become part of the child's identity.  You can tell the child that in addition to never wearing the color yellow, believing the world was created by a giant rabbit, and always snapping their fingers before eating fish, Xes are also particularly honest and industrious.  Then X children will grow up feeling it's part of their identity to be honest and industrious."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the spread and appeal of modern religions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This probably accounts for a lot of the spread of modern religions, and explains why their doctrines are a combination of the useful and the bizarre.  The bizarre half is what makes the religion stick, and the useful half is the payload."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some reasons adults lie to children, and how can these lies affect the power dynamic between them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the least excusable reasons adults lie to kids is to maintain power over them.  Sometimes these lies are truly sinister, like a child molester telling his victims they'll get in trouble if they tell anyone what happened to them.  Others seem more innocent; it depends how badly adults lie to maintain their power, and what they use it for."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some reasons adults hide their flaws from children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most adults make some effort to conceal their flaws from children. Usually their motives are mixed.  For example, a father who has an affair generally conceals it from his children.  His motive is partly that it would worry them, partly that this would introduce the topic of sex, and partly (a larger part than he would admit) that he doesn't want to tarnish himself in their eyes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is a parent's infidelity ever the fault of their spouse, or is it more about the children's perception of their parents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Really?  When a man runs off with his secretary, is it always partly his wife's fault?  But I can see why Mayle might have said this. Maybe it's more important for kids to respect their parents than to know the truth about them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the behavior of adults influence children's self-perception and feelings of guilt?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But because adults conceal their flaws, and at the same time insist on high standards of behavior for kids, a lot of kids grow up feeling they fall hopelessly short.  They walk around feeling horribly evil for having used a swearword, while in fact most of the adults around them are doing much worse things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some people feel compelled to provide answers even when they don't know them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This happens in intellectual as well as moral questions.  The more confident people are, the more willing they seem to be to answer a question \"I don't know.\"  Less confident people feel they have to have an answer or they'll look bad.  My parents were pretty good about admitting when they didn't know things, but I must have been told a lot of lies of this type by teachers, because I rarely heard a teacher say \"I don't know\" till I got to college.  I remember because it was so surprising to hear someone say that in front of a class."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the author have about teachers during their sixth-grade experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first hint I had that teachers weren't omniscient came in sixth grade, after my father contradicted something I'd learned in school. When I protested that the teacher had said the opposite, my father replied that the guy had no idea what he was talking about—that he was just an elementary school teacher, after all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What assumptions do we make about teachers' knowledge and qualifications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "a teacher?

There are some sterling exceptions, but as a rule people planning to go into teaching rank academically near the bottom of the college population.  So the fact that I still thought at age 11 that teachers were infallible shows what a job the system must have done on my brain."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of simplifying complex ideas in school curricula?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What kids get taught in school is a complex mix of lies.  The most excusable are those told to simplify ideas to make them easy to learn.  The problem is, a lot of propaganda gets slipped into the curriculum in the name of simplification."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the inherent biases present in public school textbooks regarding historical narratives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Public school textbooks represent a compromise between what various powerful groups want kids to be told.  The lies are rarely overt. Usually they consist either of omissions or of over-emphasizing certain topics at the expense of others.  The view of history we got in elementary school was a crude hagiography, with at least one representative of each powerful group."}]}

I wonder if it wouldn't have been better just to tell us the truth: that there weren't any famous black scientists.  Ranking George Washington Carver with Einstein misled us not only about science, but about the obstacles blacks faced in his time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the perception of historical figures change as one learned more about their personal lives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As subjects got softer, the lies got more frequent.  By the time you got to politics and recent history, what we were taught was pretty much pure propaganda.  For example, we were taught to regard political leaders as saints—especially the recently martyred Kennedy and King.  It was astonishing to learn later that they'd both been serial womanizers, and that Kennedy was a speed freak to boot.  (By the time King's plagiarism emerged, I'd lost the ability to be surprised by the misdeeds of famous people.)"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do adults often lie to children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Often when we lie to people it's not part of any conscious strategy, but because they'd react violently to the truth.

As the roast turkey appeared on the table, his alarmingly perceptive 5 year old son suddenly asked if the turkey had wanted to die.  Foreseeing disaster, my friend and his wife rapidly improvised: yes, the turkey had wanted to die, and in fact had lived its whole life with the aim of being their Thanksgiving dinner.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can early experiences and parental reassurances shape our perception of environmental issues?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One consequence of this sort of calming lie is that we grow up thinking horrible things are normal.  It's hard for us to feel a sense of urgency as adults over something we've literally been trained not to worry about.  When I was about 10 I saw a documentary on pollution that put me into a panic.  It seemed the planet was being irretrievably ruined.  I went to my mother afterward to ask if this was so.  I don't remember what she said, but she made me feel better, so I stopped worrying about it."}]}

If you look at what adults told children in the past, it's shocking how much they lied to them.  Like us, they did it with the best intentions.  So if we think we're as open as one could reasonably be with children, we're probably fooling ourselves.

Usually people skirt that issue with some equivocation implying that lies believed for a sufficiently long time by sufficiently large numbers of people are immune to the usual standards for truth.  But because I can't predict which lies future generations will consider inexcusable, I can't safely omit any type we tell.  Yes, it seems unlikely that religion will be out of fashion in 100 years, but no more unlikely than it would have seemed to someone in 1880 that schoolchildren in 1980 would be taught that masturbation was perfectly normal and not to feel guilty about it."}]}

When IBM introduced the PC, they thought they were going to make money selling hardware at high prices.  But by gaining control of the PC standard, Microsoft opened up the market to any manufacturer.

If you feel you're really helping people, you'll keep working even when it seems like your startup is doomed.  Most of us have some amount of natural benevolence.

So when I hear that a big, evil company is trying to stop them in order to keep search broken, it makes me really want to help them.

It's like telling the truth.  The trouble with lying is that you have to remember everything you've said in the past to make sure you don't contradict yourself.

You can't have ulterior motives when you have 57 things going on at once, because you can't remember them.  So our rule is just to do whatever's best for the founders.

In 1958 there seem to have been two ways of thinking about programming.  Some people thought of it as math, and proved things about Turing Machines. Others thought of it as a way to get things done, and designed languages all too influenced by the technology of the day.  McCarthy alone bridged the gap.  He designed a language that was math.  But designed is not really the word; discovered is more like it."}]}

That's to be expected.  Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing. And when you agree there's less to say.

Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as proving nothing.  Counterargument might prove something.  The problem is, it's hard to say exactly what."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the nature of counterarguments and why do they often lead to misunderstandings in discussions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Counterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence. When aimed squarely at the original argument, it can be convincing. But unfortunately it's common for counterarguments to be aimed at something slightly different.  More often than not, two people arguing passionately about something are actually arguing about two different things.  Sometimes they even agree with one another, but are so caught up in their squabble they don't realize it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to clarify when you are presenting a different argument from the original author's?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something slightly different from what the original author said: when you feel they missed the heart of the matter.  But when you do that, you should say explicitly you're doing it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the most convincing and rare form of disagreement, and how does it relate to the hierarchy of disagreement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation.  It's also the rarest, because it's the most work.  Indeed, the disagreement hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher you go the fewer instances you find."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the process for effectively refuting someone's argument?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To refute someone you probably have to quote them.  You have to find a \"smoking gun,\" a passage in whatever you disagree with that you feel is mistaken, and then explain why it's mistaken.  If you can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing with a straw man."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between quoting and refutation in writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn't necessarily imply refutation.  Some writers quote parts of things they disagree with to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, then follow with a response as low as DH3 or even DH0."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some tactics individuals use to undermine opposing arguments without addressing the main points?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty, as when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutes those.  Sometimes the spirit in which this is done makes it more of a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation.  For example, correcting someone's grammar, or harping on minor mistakes in names or numbers.  Unless the opposing argument actually depends on such things, the only purpose of correcting them is to discredit one's opponent."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is necessary for a refutation to be considered truly effective?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point, or at least one of them.

It's enough to refute something it depends upon."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do DH levels indicate about the correctness of a statement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "give us is a way of picking a winner.  DH levels merely describe the form of a statement, not whether it's correct.  A DH6 response could still be completely mistaken."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between DH levels and the convincingness of a response?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But while DH levels don't set a lower bound on the convincingness of a reply, they do set an upper bound.  A DH6 response might be unconvincing, but a DH2 or lower response is always unconvincing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can classifying forms of disagreement enhance critical reading skills?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement is that it will help people to evaluate what they read.  In particular, it will help them to see through intellectually dishonest arguments. An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishing an opponent merely by using forceful words.  In fact that is probably the defining quality of a demagogue.  By giving names to the different forms of disagreement, we give critical readers a pin for popping such balloons."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can recognizing one's position in a disagreement hierarchy improve the quality of a writer's argument?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Such labels may help writers too.  Most intellectual dishonesty is unintentional.  Someone arguing against the tone of something he disagrees with may believe he's really saying something.  Zooming out and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy may inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the psychological benefits of engaging in constructive disagreements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it will make conversations better, but that it will make the people who have them happier.  If you study conversations, you find there is a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6.  You don't have to be mean when you have a real point to make.  In fact, you don't want to.  If you have something real to say, being mean just gets in the way."}]}

For example, volume grows as the cube of linear dimension, but surface area only as the square.  So as animals get bigger they have trouble radiating heat.  That's why mice and rabbits are furry and elephants and hippos aren't.  You can't make a mouse by scaling down an elephant."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do venture capital funds differ from other sources of startup funding in terms of the stage of companies they typically support?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Before us, most companies in the startup funding business were venture capital funds.  VCs generally fund later stage companies than we do.  And they supply so much money that, even though the other things they do may be very valuable, it's not that inaccurate to regard VCs as sources of money.  Good VCs are \"smart money,\" but they're still money."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the role of investor support change between early-stage and late-stage funding rounds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All good investors supply a combination of money and help.  But these scale differently, just as volume and surface area do.  Late stage investors supply huge amounts of money and comparatively little help: when a company about to go public gets a mezzanine round of $50 million, the deal tends to be almost entirely about money.  As you move earlier in the venture funding process, the ratio of help to money increases, because earlier stage companies have different needs.  Early stage companies need less money because they're smaller and cheaper to run, but they need more help because life is so precarious for them.  So when VCs do a series A round for, say, $2 million, they generally expect to offer a significant amount of help along with the money."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does Y Combinator play in the startup funding process compared to venture capital funding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Y Combinator occupies the earliest end of the spectrum.  We're at least one and generally two steps before VC funding.  (Though some startups go straight from YC to VC, the most common trajectory is to do an angel round first.)  And what happens at Y Combinator is as different from what happens in a series A round as a series A round is from a mezzanine financing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the primary challenges faced by early-stage startups beyond financial considerations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At our end, money is almost a negligible factor.  The startup usually consists of just the founders. Their living expenses are the company's main expense, and since most founders are under 30, their living expenses are low.  But at this early stage companies need a lot of help.  Practically every question is still unanswered.  Some companies we've funded have been working on their software for a year or more, but others haven't decided what to work on, or even who the founders should be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common misconception do PR people and journalists have about the early stages of successful startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When PR people and journalists recount the histories of startups after they've become big, they always underestimate how uncertain things were at first.  They're not being deliberately misleading. When you look at a company like Google, it's hard to imagine they could once have been small and helpless.  Sure, at one point they were a just a couple guys in a garage—but even then their greatness was assured, and all they had to do was roll forward along the railroad tracks of destiny."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the early success of Google, and how could it have failed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Far from it.  A lot of startups with just as promising beginnings end up failing.  Google has such momentum now that it would be hard for anyone to stop them.  But all it would have taken in the beginning would have been for two Google employees to focus on the wrong things for six months, and the company could have died."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do founders of early-stage startups often become very wealthy despite the high risks involved?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We know, because we've been there, just how vulnerable startups are in the earliest phases.  Curiously enough, that's why founders tend to get so rich from them.  Reward is always proportionate to risk, and very early stage startups are insanely risky."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary function of Y Combinator in relation to startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What we really do at Y Combinator is get startups launched straight. One of many metaphors you could use for YC is a steam catapult on an aircraft carrier.  We get startups airborne.  Barely airborne, but enough that they can accelerate fast."}]}

Though we do spend a lot of time on launch strategies for products, there are some things that take too long to build for a startup to launch them before raising their next round of funding.  Several of the most promising startups we've funded haven't launched their products yet, but are definitely launched as companies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the primary focus areas for early-stage startups compared to later-stage startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the earliest stage, startups not only have more questions to answer, but they tend to be different kinds of questions.  In later stage startups the questions are about deals, or hiring, or organization.  In the earliest phase they tend to be about technology and design.  What do you make?  That's the first problem to solve. That's why our motto is \"Make something people want.\"  This is always a good thing for companies to do, but it's even more important early on, because it sets the bounds for every other question.  Who you hire, how much money you raise, how you market yourself—they all depend on what you're making."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What skills are essential for venture capitalists to be effective during the phase between series A and IPO?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because the early problems are so much about technology and design, you probably need to be hackers to do what we do.  While some VCs have technical backgrounds, I don't know any who still write code. Their expertise is mostly in business—as it should be, because that's the kind of expertise you need in the phase between series A and (if you're lucky) IPO."}]}

If the founders end up net ahead it's not coming out of them.  So is it coming out of later stage investors?  Well, they do end up paying more.  But I think they pay more because the company is actually more valuable.  And later stage investors have no problem with that.  The returns of a VC fund depend on the quality of the companies they invest in, not how cheaply they can buy stock in them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors have contributed to the decrease in costs for starting web-based startups compared to biotech startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other reason no one was doing quite what we do is that till recently it was a lot more expensive to start a startup.  You'll notice we haven't funded any biotech startups.  That's still expensive.  But advancing technology has made web startups so cheap that you really can get a company airborne for $15,000.  If you understand how to operate a steam catapult, at least."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Y Combinator differentiate itself from traditional venture capital funds in the startup ecosystem?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So in effect what's happened is that a new ecological niche has opened up, and Y Combinator is the new kind of animal that has moved into it.  We're not a replacement for venture capital funds.  We occupy a new, adjacent niche.  And conditions in our niche are really quite different.  It's not just that the problems we face are different; the whole structure of the business is different. VCs are playing a zero-sum game.  They're all competing for a slice of a fixed amount of \"deal flow,\" and that explains a lot of their behavior.  Whereas our m.o. is to create new deal flow, by encouraging hackers who would have gotten jobs to start their own startups instead.  We compete more with employers than VCs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the evolution of the venture capital industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not surprising something like this would happen.  Most fields become more specialized—more articulated—as they develop, and startups are certainly an area in which there has been a lot of development over the past couple decades.  The venture business in its present form is only about forty years old.  It stands to reason it would evolve."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What metaphor does Y Combinator use to describe its role beyond traditional startup funding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And it's natural that the new niche would at first be described, even by its inhabitants, in terms of the old one.  But really Y Combinator is not in the startup funding business.  Really we're more of a small, furry steam catapult."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do online communities face regarding the behavior of trolls?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've thought a lot over the last couple years about the problem of trolls.  It's an old one, as old as forums, but we're still just learning what the causes are and how to address them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the original meaning of the term \"troll\" in online forums?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two senses of the word \"troll.\"  In the original sense it meant someone, usually an outsider, who deliberately stirred up fights in a forum by saying controversial things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an example of trolling behavior in online forums?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, someone who didn't use a certain programming language might go to a forum for users of that language and make disparaging remarks about it, then sit back and watch as people rose to the bait.  This sort of trolling was in the nature of a practical joke, like letting a bat loose in a room full of people."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the definition of \"troll\" evolved in online communities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The definition then spread to people who behaved like assholes in forums, whether intentionally or not.  Now when people talk about trolls they usually mean this broader sense of the word.  Though in a sense this is historically inaccurate, it is in other ways more accurate, because when someone is being an asshole it's usually uncertain even in their own mind how much is deliberate. That is arguably one of the defining qualities of an asshole."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some psychological factors that contribute to trolling behavior online?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think trolling in the broader sense has four causes.  The most important is distance.  People will say things in anonymous forums that they'd never dare say to someone's face, just as they'll do things in cars that they'd never do as pedestrians — like tailgate people, or honk at them, or cut them off."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is trolling more prevalent in computer-related forums?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Trolling tends to be particularly bad in forums related to computers, and I think that's due to the kind of people you find there.  Most of them (myself included) are more comfortable dealing with abstract ideas than with people.  Hackers can be abrupt even in person.

I haven't read the essay, but there's no way anything so short and written in such an informal style could have anything useful to say about such and such topic, when people with degrees in the subject have already written many thick books about it.\" Now there's a new generation of trolls on a new generation of sites, but they have at least started to omit the initial \"Who is this guy?\""}]}

Though simple solutions are better, they don't seem as impressive as complex ones.  Overlooked problems are by definition problems that most people think don't matter.  Delivering solutions in an informal way means that instead of judging something by the way it's presented, people have to actually understand it, which is more work.

This technique is successful (in the long term) because it gives you all the advantages other people forgo by trying to seem legit.  If you work on overlooked problems, you're more likely to discover new things, because you have less competition.  If you deliver solutions informally, you (a) save all the effort you would have had to expend to make them look impressive, and (b) avoid the danger of fooling yourself as well as your audience.  And if you release a crude version 1 then iterate, your solution can benefit from the imagination of nature, which, as Feynman pointed out, is more powerful than your own."}]}

The overlooked problem was to generate web sites automatically; in 1995, online stores were all made by hand by human designers, but we knew this wouldn't scale.  The part that actually mattered was graphic design, not transaction processing. The informal delivery mechanism was me, showing up in jeans and a t-shirt at some retailer's office.

So look for simple things that other people have overlooked—things people will later claim were \"obvious\"—especially when they've been led astray by obsolete conventions, or by trying to do things that are superficially impressive.  Figure out what the real problem is, and make sure you solve that.  Don't worry about trying to look corporate; the product is what wins in the long term.

When Reddit first launched, it seemed like there was nothing to it.  To the graphically unsophisticated its deliberately minimal design seemed like no design at all.  But Reddit solved the real problem, which was to tell people what was new and otherwise stay out of the way.  As a result it became massively successful.  Now that conventional ideas have caught up with it, it seems obvious.  People look at Reddit and think the founders were lucky.  Like all such things, it was harder than it looked.

Most people could see how it might be helpful to be in a place where there was infrastructure for startups, accumulated knowledge about how to make them work, and other people trying to do it.

At this year's Boston Demo Day, I told the audience that this happened every year, so if they saw a startup they liked, they should make them an offer. And yet within a month it had happened again: an aggressive west coast VC who had met the founder of a YC-funded startup a week before beat out a Boston VC who had known him for years.

A lot of people, probably the majority of people in America, have some amount of insecurity about where, or whether, they went to college.

Colleges are a bit like exclusive clubs in this respect.  There is only one real advantage to being a member of most exclusive clubs: you know you wouldn't be missing much if you weren't.

If you start with too big a problem, you may never quite be able to encompass it.  So if you need to write a big, complex program, the best way to begin may not be to write a spec for it, but to write a prototype that solves a subset of the problem.

This works well for more parallelizable tasks, like fighting wars.

Most startups grow fast or die; if you die you don't have to pay the guy, and if you grow fast you'll be paying next year's salary out of next year's valuation, which should be 3x this year's.

If you're feeling really confident, you can try to ride it.  You can start by asking a comparatively lowly VC for a small amount of money, and then after generating interest there, ask more prestigious VCs for larger amounts, stirring up a crescendo of buzz, and then \"sell\" at the top.  This is extremely risky, and takes months even if you succeed. I wouldn't try it myself.  My advice is to err on the side of safety: when someone offers you a decent deal, just take it and get on with building the company.

Those few big wins compensate for losses on their other investments.  What this means is that most VCs will only invest in you if you're a potential Google.

A typical VC fund is now hundreds of millions of dollars.  If $400 million has to be invested by 10 partners, they have to invest $40 million each.  VCs usually sit on the boards of companies they fund.  If the average deal size was $1 million, each partner would have to sit on 40 boards, which would not be fun.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists prefer to invest at higher valuations compared to initial angel investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Valuations increase as the size of the investment does.  A company that an angel is willing to put $50,000 into at a valuation of a million can't take $6 million from VCs at that valuation.  That would leave the founders less than a seventh of the company between them (since the option pool would also come out of that seventh). Most VCs wouldn't want that, which is why you never hear of deals where a VC invests $6 million at a premoney valuation of $1 million."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might a high valuation be detrimental for startup founders seeking an acquisition?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since valuations are made up, founders shouldn't care too much about them.  That's not the part to focus on.  In fact, a high valuation can be a bad thing.  If you take funding at a premoney valuation of $10 million, you won't be selling the company for 20.  You'll have to sell for over 50 for the VCs to get even a 5x return, which is low to them.  More likely they'll want you to hold out for 100. But needing to get a high price decreases the chance of getting bought at all; many companies can buy you for $10 million, but only a handful for 100.  And since a startup is like a pass/fail course for the founders, what you want to optimize is your chance of a good outcome, not the percentage of the company you keep."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates founders to pursue high valuations, and what potential pitfalls might this ambition lead to?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So why do founders chase high valuations?  They're tricked by misplaced ambition.  They feel they've achieved more if they get a higher valuation.  They usually know other founders, and if they get a higher valuation they can say \"mine is bigger than yours.\" But funding is not the real test.  The real test is the final outcome for the founder, and getting too high a valuation may just make a good outcome less likely."}]}

This is like funding Steve Ballmer in the hope that the programmer he'll hire is Bill Gates—kind of backward, as the events of the Bubble showed.

You'd expect them to be cold and calculating, or at least businesslike, but often they're not.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key stages in the process of negotiating an investment or acquisition deal?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most deals, for investment or acquisition, happen in two phases. There's an initial phase of negotiation about the big questions. If this succeeds you get a termsheet, so called because it outlines the key terms of a deal.  A termsheet is not legally binding, but it is a definite step.  It's supposed to mean that a deal is going to happen, once the lawyers work out all the details. In theory these details are minor ones; by definition all the important points are supposed to be covered in the termsheet."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for founders to remain proactive and engaged after receiving a termsheet?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Inexperience and wishful thinking combine to make founders feel that when they have a termsheet, they have a deal.  They want there to be a deal; everyone acts like they have a deal; so there must be a deal.  But there isn't and may not be for several months.  A lot can change for a startup in several months.  It's not uncommon for investors and acquirers to get buyer's remorse.  So you have to keep pushing, keep selling, all the way to the close.  Otherwise all the \"minor\" details left unspecified in the termsheet will be interpreted to your disadvantage.  The other side may even break the deal; if they do that, they'll usually seize on some technicality or claim you misled them, rather than admitting they changed their minds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can a startup maintain investor interest from the initial termsheet to closing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It can be hard to keep the pressure on an investor or acquirer all the way to the closing, because the most effective pressure is competition from other investors or acquirers, and these tend to drop away when you get a termsheet.  You should try to stay as close friends as you can with these rivals, but the most important thing is just to keep up the momentum in your startup.  The investors or acquirers chose you because you seemed hot.  Keep doing whatever made you seem hot.  Keep releasing new features; keep getting new users; keep getting mentioned in the press and in blogs."}]}

You might think that if they found a good deal they'd want it all to themselves, but they seem positively eager to syndicate.  This is understandable with angels; they invest on a smaller scale and don't like to have too much money tied up in any one deal.  But VCs also share deals a lot.  Why?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do deals with multiple venture capitalists tend to close more frequently?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Partly I think this is an artifact of the rule I quoted earlier: after traffic, VCs care most what other VCs think.  A deal that has multiple VCs interested in it is more likely to close, so of deals that close, more will have multiple investors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the rationale behind involving multiple venture capitalists in a funding deal?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is one rational reason to want multiple VCs in a deal: Any investor who co-invests with you is one less investor who could fund a competitor.  Apparently Kleiner and Sequoia didn't like splitting the Google deal, but it did at least have the advantage, from each one's point of view, that there probably wouldn't be a competitor funded by the other.  Splitting deals thus has similar advantages to confusing paternity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists prefer to share investment deals with other firms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I think the main reason VCs like splitting deals is the fear of looking bad.

The reason, again, is that there are so many deals.  Though a professional investor may have a closer relationship with a founder he invests in than with other investors, his relationship with the founder is only going to last a couple years, whereas his relationship with other firms will last his whole career.  There isn't so much at stake in his interactions with other investors, but there will be a lot of them.  Professional investors are constantly trading little favors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do investors avoid competitive bidding in startup funding rounds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another reason investors stick together is to preserve the power of investors as a whole.  So you will not, as of this writing, be able to get investors into an auction for your series A round.

Investors are rich enough to be rational and prefer the latter.  So they'll always tend to encourage founders to keep rolling the dice.  If a company is doing well, investors will want founders to turn down most acquisition offers.  And indeed, most startups that turn down acquisition offers ultimately do better. But it's still hair-raising for the founders, because they might end up with nothing.

That should correct the problem. Most founders have such low standards that they'll feel rich with a sum that doesn't seem huge to investors. But this custom is spreading too slowly, because VCs are afraid of seeming irresponsible.  No one wants to be the first VC to give someone fuck-you money and then actually get told \"fuck you.\" But until this does start to happen, we know VCs are being too conservative."}]}

When a VC firm has been successful in the past, everyone wants funding from them, so they get the pick of all the new deals.  The self-reinforcing nature of the venture funding market means that the top ten firms live in a completely different world from, say, the hundredth.  As well as being smarter, they tend to be calmer and more upstanding; they don't need to do iffy things to get an edge, and don't want to because they have more brand to protect."}]}

It's not unusual for it to take five or six months to close a funding round.  Six weeks is fast.  And raising money is not just something you can leave running as a background process.

But companies do. So there is a big opportunity here for a new kind of venture fund that invests smaller amounts at lower valuations, but promises to either close or say no very quickly.  If there were such a firm, I'd recommend it to startups in preference to any other, no matter how prestigious. Startups live on speed and momentum."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists often take a long time to finalize funding deals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason funding deals take so long to close is mainly that investors can't make up their minds.  VCs are not big companies; they can do a deal in 24 hours if they need to.  But they usually let the initial meetings stretch out over a couple weeks.  The reason is the selection algorithm I mentioned earlier.  Most don't try to predict whether a startup will win, but to notice quickly that it already is winning.  They care what the market thinks of you and what other VCs think of you, and they can't judge those just from meeting you."}]}

The software business was overhung by a monopoly from about the mid-1950s to about 2005.  For practically its whole existence, that is.

But that isn't true.  Some wisdom has nothing to do with people: for example, the wisdom of the engineer who knows certain structures are less prone to failure than others.  And certainly smart people can find clever solutions to human problems as well as abstract ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to wisdom beyond just experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another popular explanation is that wisdom comes from experience while intelligence is innate.  But people are not simply wise in proportion to how much experience they have.  Other things must contribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: a reflective disposition, for example."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the distinction between wisdom and intelligence based on their usage in language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Neither of the conventional explanations of the difference between wisdom and intelligence stands up to scrutiny.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between being wise and being smart?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Wise\" and \"smart\" are both ways of saying someone knows what to do.  The difference is that \"wise\" means one has a high average outcome across all situations, and \"smart\" means one does spectacularly well in a few.  That is, if you had a graph in which the x axis represented situations and the y axis the outcome, the graph of the wise person would be high overall, and the graph of the smart person would have high peaks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How should intelligence and wisdom be evaluated in relation to their respective best and average states?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent at its best and character at its worst.  Except you judge intelligence at its best, and wisdom by its average.  That's how the two are related: they're the two different senses in which the same curve can be high."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes a wise person from a smart person in terms of decision-making?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart person knows what to do in situations where few others could.  We need to add one more qualification: we should ignore cases where someone knows what to do because they have inside information."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do wisdom and intelligence differ in their relation to human problem-solving and achieving high outcomes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nor do we need to.  Simple as it is, this explanation predicts, or at least accords with, both of the conventional stories about the distinction between wisdom and intelligence.  Human problems are the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in achieving a high average outcome.   And it seems natural that a high average outcome depends mostly on experience, but that dramatic peaks can only be achieved by people with certain rare, innate qualities; nearly anyone can learn to be a good swimmer, but to be an Olympic swimmer you need a certain body type."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the nature of wisdom and its existence as a distinct quality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept: there's no such thing.  \"Wise\" means something—that one is on average good at making the right choice.  But giving the name \"wisdom\" to the supposed quality that enables one to do that doesn't mean such a thing exists.  To the extent \"wisdom\" means anything, it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline, experience, and empathy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the complexities and misconceptions surrounding the concept of intelligence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Likewise, though \"intelligent\" means something, we're asking for trouble if we insist on looking for a single thing called \"intelligence.\" And whatever its components, they're not all innate.  We use the word \"intelligent\" as an indication of ability: a smart person can grasp things few others could.  It does seem likely there's some inborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but this predisposition is not itself intelligence."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do we often perceive intelligence as an inborn trait rather than something influenced by experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people trying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it that are most measurable.  A quality that's inborn will obviously be more convenient to work with than one that's influenced by experience, and thus might vary in the course of a study.  The problem comes when we drag the word \"intelligence\" over onto what they're measuring. If they're measuring something inborn, they can't be measuring intelligence.  Three year olds aren't smart.   When we describe one as smart, it's shorthand for \"smarter than other three year olds.\""}]}

If there's just one point, they're identical: the average and maximum are the same.  But as the number of points increases, wisdom and intelligence diverge.  And historically the number of points on the curve seems to have been increasing: our ability is tested in an ever wider range of situations."}]}

Distinguishing between \"wise\" and \"smart\" is a modern habit."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the specialization of knowledge impact the distinction between high and average performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And the reason we do is that they've been diverging.  As knowledge gets more specialized, there are more points on the curve, and the distinction between the spikes and the average becomes sharper, like a digital image rendered with more pixels."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the relationship between intelligence and wisdom evolved, and what implications does this have for our preferences in learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One consequence is that some old recipes may have become obsolete. At the very least we have to go back and figure out if they were really recipes for wisdom or intelligence.  But the really striking change, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may have to decide which we prefer.  We may not be able to optimize for both simultaneously."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has society's admiration shifted from wisdom to intelligence over the centuries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Society seems to have voted for intelligence.  We no longer admire the sage—not the way people did two thousand years ago.  Now we admire the genius.  Because in fact the distinction we began with has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without being very wise, you can be wise without being very smart.  That doesn't sound especially admirable.  That gets you James Bond, who knows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for the ones involving math."}]}

In fact, a high average may help support high peaks.  But there are reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between them.  One is the example of very smart people, who are so often unwise that in popular culture this now seems to be regarded as the rule rather than the exception.  Perhaps the absent-minded professor is wise in his way, or wiser than he seems, but he's not wise in the way Confucius or Socrates wanted people to be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Confucius and Socrates conceptualize the relationship between wisdom, virtue, and happiness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For both Confucius and Socrates, wisdom, virtue, and happiness were necessarily related.  The wise man was someone who knew what the right choice was and always made it; to be the right choice, it had to be morally right; he was therefore always happy, knowing he'd done the best he could.  I can't think of many ancient philosophers who would have disagreed with that, so far as it goes."}]}

Time after time, something that seemed a small and uninteresting area—experimental error, even—turns out, when examined up close, to have as much in it as all knowledge up to that point.  Several of the fractal buds that have exploded since ancient times involve inventing and discovering new things.  Math, for example, used to be something a handful of people did part-time.  Now it's the career of thousands. And in work that involves making new things, some old rules don't apply."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the author's approach to advising others differ from their feelings about writing essays?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Recently I've spent some time advising people, and there I find the ancient rule still works: try to understand the situation as well as you can, give the best advice you can based on your experience, and then don't worry about it, knowing you did all you could.  But I don't have anything like this serenity when I'm writing an essay. Then I'm worried.  What if I run out of ideas?

Makers depend on something more precarious: inspiration.  And like most people who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried, not contented.  In that respect they're more like the small man of Confucius's day, always one bad harvest (or ruler) away from starvation. Except instead of being at the mercy of weather and officials, they're at the mercy of their own imagination."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it acceptable to feel discontented even when one is considered successful?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To me it was a relief just to realize it might be ok to be discontented. The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of years of momentum behind it.  If I was any good, why didn't I have the easy confidence winners are supposed to have?  But that, I now believe, is like a runner asking \"If I'm such a good athlete, why do I feel so tired?\" Good runners still get tired; they just get tired at higher speeds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do inventors and discoverers measure their success compared to athletes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People whose work is to invent or discover things are in the same position as the runner.  There's no way for them to do the best they can, because there's no limit to what they could do.  The closest you can come is to compare yourself to other people.  But the better you do, the less this matters.  An undergrad who gets something published feels like a star.  But for someone at the top of the field, what's the test of doing well?  Runners can at least compare themselves to others doing exactly the same thing; if you win an Olympic gold medal, you can be fairly content, even if you think you could have run a bit faster.  But what is a novelist to do?"}]}

In ancient societies, nearly all work seems to have been of this type.  The peasant had to decide whether a garment was worth mending, and the king whether or not to invade his neighbor, but neither was expected to invent anything.  In principle they could have; the king could have invented firearms, then invaded his neighbor.  But in practice innovations were so rare that they weren't expected of you, any more than goalkeepers are expected to score goals."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the perception of decision-making in high-stakes situations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In practice, it seemed as if there was a correct decision in every situation, and if you made it you'd done your job perfectly, just as a goalkeeper who prevents the other team from scoring is considered to have played a perfect game."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the evolution of work and knowledge specialization affected the importance of intelligence compared to wisdom?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even now, most people do work in which problems are put before them and they have to choose the best alternative.  But as knowledge has grown more specialized, there are more and more types of work in which people have to make up new things, and in which performance is therefore unbounded.  Intelligence has become increasingly important relative to wisdom because there is more room for spikes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do intelligence and wisdom differ in their development and characteristics?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another sign we may have to choose between intelligence and wisdom is how different their recipes are.  Wisdom seems to come largely from curing childish qualities, and intelligence largely from cultivating them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of self-control and experience in the pursuit of wisdom?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Recipes for wisdom, particularly ancient ones, tend to have a remedial character.  To achieve wisdom one must cut away all the debris that fills one's head on emergence from childhood, leaving only the important stuff.  Both self-control and experience have this effect: to eliminate the random biases that come from your own nature and from the circumstances of your upbringing respectively. That's not all wisdom is, but it's a large part of it.  Much of what's in the sage's head is also in the head of every twelve year old.  The difference is that in the head of the twelve year old it's mixed together with a lot of random junk."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can individuals effectively cultivate their intelligence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The path to intelligence seems to be through working on hard problems. You develop intelligence as you might develop muscles, through exercise.  But there can't be too much compulsion here.  No amount of discipline can replace genuine curiosity.  So cultivating intelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one's character—some tendency to be interested in certain types of things—and nurturing it.  Instead of obliterating your idiosyncrasies in an effort to make yourself a neutral vessel for the truth, you select one and try to grow it from a seedling into a tree."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the main criticism of traditional educational methods in relation to developing intelligence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most of our educational traditions aim at wisdom. So perhaps one reason schools work badly is that they're trying to make intelligence using recipes for wisdom.  Most recipes for wisdom have an element of subjection.  At the very least, you're supposed to do what the teacher says.  The more extreme recipes aim to break down your individuality the way basic training does.  But that's not the route to intelligence.  Whereas wisdom comes through humility, it may actually help, in cultivating intelligence, to have a mistakenly high opinion of your abilities, because that encourages you to keep working.  Ideally till you realize how mistaken you were."}]}

I'm not proposing the primary goal of education should be to increase students' \"self-esteem.\" That just breeds laziness.  And in any case, it doesn't really fool the kids, not the smart ones.

You have to be a good audience: appreciative, but not too easily impressed.  And that's a lot of work.  You have to have a good enough grasp of kids' capacities at different ages to know when to be surprised."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of traditional educational methods in terms of student engagement and learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's the opposite of traditional recipes for education.  Traditionally the student is the audience, not the teacher; the student's job is not to invent, but to absorb some prescribed body of material.

But I think it's important to understand the relationship between intelligence and wisdom, and particularly what seems to be the growing gap between them.  That way we can avoid applying rules and standards to intelligence that are really meant for wisdom.  These two senses of \"knowing what to do\" are more different than most people realize.  The path to wisdom is through discipline, and the path to intelligence through carefully selected self-indulgence.  Wisdom is universal, and intelligence idiosyncratic.

The winners slow down the least.  It's that way with most startups too.  The earliest phase is usually the most productive.  That's when they have the really big ideas.

I bet most executives at big companies do their best thinking when they wake up on Sunday morning and go downstairs in their bathrobe to make a cup of coffee.  That's when you have ideas.  Just imagine what a company would be like if people could think that well at work.  People do in startups, at least some of the time.

If there's no such thing as better, it doesn't matter what you do.  In fact, it doesn't matter if you paint at all.  You could just go out and buy a ready-made blank canvas.  If there's no such thing as good, that would be just as great an achievement as the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.  Less laborious, certainly, but if you can achieve the same level of performance with less effort, surely that's more impressive, not less."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the effectiveness of art in engaging its audience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think the key to this puzzle is to remember that art has an audience.  Art has a purpose, which is to interest its audience. Good art (like good anything) is art that achieves its purpose particularly well.  The meaning of \"interest\" can vary.  Some works of art are meant to shock, and others to please; some are meant to jump out at you, and others to sit quietly in the background. But all art has to work on an audience, and—here's the critical point—members of the audience share things in common."}]}

It seems to be wired into us.  Babies can recognize faces practically from birth.  In fact, faces seem to have co-evolved with our interest in them; the face is the body's billboard.  So all other things being equal, a painting with faces in it will interest people more than one without."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges arise when trying to evaluate and compare taste among individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason it's easy to believe that taste is merely personal preference is that, if it isn't, how do you pick out the people with better taste?  There are billions of people, each with their own opinion; on what grounds can you prefer one to another?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the engagement with faces considered a universal trait among audiences when evaluating art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But if audiences have a lot in common, you're not in a position of having to choose one out of a random set of individual biases, because the set isn't random.  All humans find faces engaging—practically by definition: face recognition is in our DNA.  And so having a notion of good art, in the sense of art that does its job well, doesn't require you to pick out a few individuals and label their opinions as correct.  No matter who you pick, they'll find faces engaging."}]}

But there might be other things they shared in common with us.  The most likely source of examples is math.  I expect space aliens would agree with us most of the time about which of two proofs was better. Erdos thought so.  He called a maximally elegant proof one out of God's book, and presumably God's book is universal."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can we understand the concept of taste in relation to different audiences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Once you start talking about audiences, you don't have to argue simply that there are or aren't standards of taste.  Instead tastes are a series of concentric rings, like ripples in a pond.  There are some things that will appeal to you and your friends, others that will appeal to most people your age, others that will appeal to most humans, and perhaps others that would appeal to most sentient beings (whatever that means)."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria should we use to evaluate the quality of art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If good art is art that interests its audience, then when you talk about art being good, you also have to say for what audience.  So is it meaningless to talk about art simply being good or bad?  No, because one audience is the set of all possible humans.  I think that's the audience people are implicitly talking about when they say a work of art is good: they mean it would engage any human."}]}

In addition to our interest in faces, there's something special about primary colors for nearly all of us, because it's an artifact of the way our eyes work.  Most humans will also find images of 3D objects engaging, because that also seems to be built into our visual perception."}]}

My goal is not to compile a complete list, just to show that there's some solid ground here.  People's preferences aren't random.  So an artist working on a painting and trying to decide whether to change some part of it doesn't have to think \"Why bother?  I might as well flip a coin.\" Instead he can ask \"What would make the painting more interesting to people?\"  And the reason you can't equal Michelangelo by going out and buying a blank canvas is that the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is more interesting to people."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can beauty in art be considered an objective property of objects rather than merely a subjective experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A lot of philosophers have had a hard time believing it was possible for there to be objective standards for art. It seemed obvious that beauty, for example, was something that happened in the head of the observer, not something that was a property of objects.  It was thus \"subjective\" rather than \"objective.\"  But in fact if you narrow the definition of beauty to something that works a certain way on humans, and you observe how much humans have in common, it turns out to be a property of objects after all.   You don't have to choose between something being a property of the subject or the object if subjects all react similarly. Being good art is thus a property of objects as much as, say, being toxic to humans is: it's good art if it consistently affects humans in a certain way."}]}

For products of nature that might work.  I'd be willing to eat the apple the world's population had voted most delicious, and I'd probably be willing to visit the beach they voted most beautiful, but having to look at the painting they voted the best would be a crapshoot."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do artists manipulate viewer expectations through the presentation of their work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Man-made stuff is different.  For one thing, artists, unlike apple trees, often deliberately try to trick us.  Some tricks are quite subtle.  For example, any work of art sets expectations by its level of finish.  You don't expect photographic accuracy in something that looks like a quick sketch.  So one widely used trick, especially among illustrators, is to intentionally make a painting or drawing look like it was done faster than it was.  The average person looks at it and thinks: how amazingly skillful.  It's like saying something clever in a conversation as if you'd thought of it on the spur of the moment, when in fact you'd worked it out the day before."}]}

If you go to see the Mona Lisa, you'll probably be disappointed, because it's hidden behind a thick glass wall and surrounded by a frenzied crowd taking pictures of themselves in front of it.  At best you can see it the way you see a friend across the room at a crowded party.  The Louvre might as well replace it with copy; no one would be able to tell. And yet the Mona Lisa is a small, dark painting.  If you found people who'd never seen an image of it and sent them to a museum in which it was hanging among other paintings with a tag labelling it as a portrait by an unknown fifteenth century artist, most would walk by without giving it a second look."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does brand recognition influence people's perception of art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For the average person, brand dominates all other factors in the judgement of art.

Though appeal to people is a meaningful test, in practice you can't measure it, just as you can't find north using a compass with a magnet sitting next to it. There are sources of error so powerful that if you take a vote, all you're measuring is the error."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one develop a deeper appreciation for a famous painting beyond its initial fame?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, while anyone's reaction to a famous painting will be warped at first by its fame, there are ways to decrease its effects. One is to come back to the painting over and over.  After a few days the fame wears off, and you can start to see it as a painting. Another is to stand close.  A painting familiar from reproductions looks more familiar from ten feet away; close in you see details that get lost in reproductions, and which you're therefore seeing for the first time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two main types of errors that can affect one's perception of art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two main kinds of error that get in the way of seeing a work of art: biases you bring from your own circumstances, and tricks played by the artist.  Tricks are straightforward to correct for. Merely being aware of them usually prevents them from working. For example, when I was ten I used to be very impressed by airbrushed lettering that looked like shiny metal.  But once you study how it's done, you see that it's a pretty cheesy trick—one of the sort that relies on pushing a few visual buttons really hard to temporarily overwhelm the viewer.  It's like trying to convince someone by shouting at them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one protect themselves from being deceived by manipulative art or presentations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The way not to be vulnerable to tricks is to explicitly seek out and catalog them.  When you notice a whiff of dishonesty coming from some kind of art, stop and figure out what's going on.  When someone is obviously pandering to an audience that's easily fooled, whether it's someone making shiny stuff to impress ten year olds, or someone making conspicuously avant-garde stuff to impress would-be intellectuals, learn how they do it.  Once you've seen enough examples of specific types of tricks, you start to become a connoisseur of trickery in general, just as professional magicians are."}]}

Roughly, it's something done with contempt for the audience.  For example, the guys designing Ferraris in the 1950s were probably designing cars that they themselves admired. Whereas I suspect over at General Motors the marketing people are telling the designers, \"Most people who buy SUVs do it to seem manly, not to drive off-road. So don't worry about the suspension; just make that sucker as big and tough-looking as you can.\""}]}

It's harder to escape the influence of your own circumstances, but you can at least move in that direction.  The way to do it is to travel widely, in both time and space.  If you go and see all the different kinds of things people like in other cultures, and learn about all the different things people have liked in the past, you'll probably find it changes what you like.  I doubt you could ever make yourself into a completely universal person, if only because you can only travel in one direction in time.  But if you find a work of art that would appeal equally to your friends, to people in Nepal, and to the ancient Greeks, you're probably onto something."}]}

Art is man-made. It comes with a lot of cultural baggage, and in addition the people who make it often try to trick us.  Most people's judgement of art is dominated by these extraneous factors; they're like someone trying to judge the taste of apples in a dish made of equal parts apples and jalapeno peppers.  All they're tasting is the peppers.  So it turns out you can pick out some people and say that they have better taste than others: they're the ones who actually taste art like apples."}]}

If you could find people who'd eliminated all such influences on their judgement, you'd probably still see variation in what they liked. But because humans have so much in common, you'd also find they agreed on a lot.  They'd nearly all prefer the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to a blank canvas."}]}

Anyone who makes things knows intuitively that's not true.  When you're trying to make art, the temptation to be lazy is as great as in any other kind of work. Of course it matters to do a good job.  And yet you can see how great a hold \"taste is subjective\" has even in the art world by how nervous it makes people to talk about art being good or bad.  Those whose jobs require them to judge art, like curators, mostly resort to euphemisms like \"significant\" or \"important\" or (getting dangerously close) \"realized.\""}]}

Junior professors are fired by default after a few years unless the university chooses to grant them tenure.  Professional athletes know they'll be pulled if they play badly for just a couple games.

In the US it's ok to be overtly ambitious, and in most of Europe it's not.  But this can't be an intrinsically European quality; previous generations of Europeans were as ambitious as Americans.

But a place that tolerates oddness in the search for the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, because economically that's what startups are.  Most good startup ideas seem a little crazy; if they were obviously good ideas, someone would have done them already."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the establishment of Silicon Valley in Palo Alto?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A great university near an attractive town.  Is that all it takes? That was all it took to make the original Silicon Valley.  Silicon Valley traces its origins to William Shockley, one of the inventors of the transistor.  He did the research that won him the Nobel Prize at Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956 he moved to Palo Alto to do it.   At the time that was an odd thing to do. Why did he?  Because he had grown up there and remembered how nice it was.  Now Palo Alto is suburbia, but then it was a charming college town-- a charming college town with perfect weather and San Francisco only an hour away."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Shockley Semiconductor influence the development of major technology companies in Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The companies that rule Silicon Valley now are all descended in various ways from Shockley Semiconductor.  Shockley was a difficult man, and in 1957 his top people-- \"the traitorous eight\"-- left to start a new company, Fairchild Semiconductor.  Among them were Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, and Eugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm Kleiner Perkins.  Forty-two years later, Kleiner Perkins funded Google, and the partner responsible for the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 to work for Intel."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does the history of successful startups play in fostering the growth of new companies in Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So although a lot of the newest companies in Silicon Valley don't make anything out of silicon, there always seem to be multiple links back to Shockley.  There's a lesson here: startups beget startups. People who work for startups start their own.  People who get rich from startups fund new ones.  I suspect this kind of organic growth is the only way to produce a startup hub, because it's the only way to grow the expertise you need."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key factors influencing the growth of a startup community in relation to a university?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That has two important implications.  The first is that you need time to grow a silicon valley.  The university you could create in a couple years, but the startup community around it has to grow organically.   The cycle time is limited by the time it takes a company to succeed, which probably averages about five years."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the organic growth hypothesis suggest about the existence of startup hubs in cities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that you can't be somewhat of a startup hub.  You either have a self-sustaining chain reaction, or not.  Observation confirms this too: cities either have a startup scene, or they don't.  There is no middle ground.  Chicago has the third largest metropolitan area in America. As a source of startups it's negligible compared to Seattle, number 15."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role did Shockley Semiconductor play in the development of new technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The good news is that the initial seed can be quite small.  Shockley Semiconductor, though itself not very successful, was big enough. It brought a critical mass of experts in an important new technology together in a place they liked enough to stay."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the structure of companies in Silicon Valley during Shockley's era differ from the modern startup model?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of Silicon Valley's biggest advantages is its venture capital firms.  This was not a factor in Shockley's day, because VC funds didn't exist.  In fact, Shockley Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor were not startups at all in our sense.  They were subsidiaries-- of Beckman Instruments and Fairchild Camera and Instrument respectively.  Those companies were apparently willing to establish subsidiaries wherever the experts wanted to live."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture investors prefer to fund startups located near them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Venture investors, however, prefer to fund startups within an hour's drive.  For one, they're more likely to notice startups nearby. But when they do notice startups in other towns they prefer them to move.  They don't want to have to travel to attend board meetings, and in any case the odds of succeeding are higher in a startup hub."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do venture firms influence the formation and growth of startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The centralizing effect of venture firms is a double one: they cause startups to form around them, and those draw in more startups through acquisitions.  And although the first may be weakening because it's now so cheap to start some startups, the second seems as strong as ever. Three of the most admired \"Web 2.0\" companies were started outside the usual startup hubs, but two of them have already been reeled in through acquisitions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors could allow a new tech hub to compete with or surpass Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Such centralizing forces make it harder for new silicon valleys to get started.  But by no means impossible.  Ultimately power rests with the founders.  A startup with the best people will beat one with funding from famous VCs, and a startup that was sufficiently successful would never have to move.  So a town that could exert enough pull over the right people could resist and perhaps even surpass Silicon Valley."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the funding process for academic research differ from that of startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bureaucrats manage to allocate research funding moderately well, but only because (like an in-house VC fund) they outsource most of the work of selection.  A professor at a famous university who is highly regarded by his peers will get funding, pretty much regardless of the proposal.  That wouldn't work for startups, whose founders aren't sponsored by organizations, and are often unknowns."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for startups to release their initial software version quickly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast.  One is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for a startup or not.  I've been repeating that since 1993, and I haven't seen much since to contradict it.  I've seen a lot of startups die because they were too slow to release stuff, and none because they were too quick."}]}

And Wufoo got valuable feedback from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they rewrote their software not to.  If they'd waited to release everything at once, they wouldn't have discovered this problem till it was more deeply wired in."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for startups to prioritize a quick initial release, even without users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even if you had no users, it would still be important to release quickly, because for a startup the initial release acts as a shakedown cruise.  If anything major is broken-- if the idea's no good, for example, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of getting that first version out will expose it.  And if you have such problems you want to find them early."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the impact of releasing a project early on the motivation and urgency of the team?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that it makes you work harder.  When you're working on something that isn't released, problems are intriguing.  In something that's out there, problems are alarming.  There is a lot more urgency once you release.  And I think that's precisely why people put it off.  They know they'll have to work a lot harder once they do."}]}

If you run every day, you'll probably feel like running tomorrow.  But if you skip running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself out.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often become complacent with existing products and overlook potential improvements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it?  I think the problem here is that people get used to how things are. Once a product gets past the stage where it has glaring flaws, you start to get used to it, and gradually whatever features it happens to have become its identity.  For example, I doubt many people at Yahoo (or Google for that matter) realized how much better web mail could be till Paul Buchheit showed them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset can help enhance creativity and drive continuous improvement in your work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think the solution is to assume that anything you've made is far short of what it could be.

One thing all startups have in common is that they can't force anyone to do anything.  They can't force anyone to use their software, and they can't force anyone to do deals with them. A startup has to sing for its supper.  That's why the successful ones make great things.  They have to, or die."}]}

But if this is your attitude, \"something great\" is very unlikely to happen to you, because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of commitment."}]}

I carefully chose the word determined rather than stubborn, because stubbornness is a disastrous quality in a startup.  You have to be determined, but flexible, like a running back.  A successful running back doesn't just put his head down and try to run through people.  He improvises: if someone appears in front of him, he runs around them; if someone tries to grab him, he spins out of their grip; he'll even run in the wrong direction briefly if that will help.  The one thing he'll never do is stand still."}]}

Not likely."}]}

For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to make a better search engine than Google.  Surely that field, at least, is tapped out.  Really?  In a hundred years-- or even twenty-- are people still going to search for information using something like the current Google?  Even Google probably doesn't think that."}]}

Sometimes you hear people saying \"All these guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed. How many little startups are Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?\" That sounds cleverly skeptical, but I can prove it's mistaken.  No one proposes that there's some limit to the number of people who can be employed in an economy consisting of big, slow-moving companies with a couple thousand people each.  Why should there be any limit to the number who could be employed by small, fast-moving companies with ten each?

Deals are dynamic; unless you're negotiating with someone unusually honest, there's not a single point where you shake hands and the deal's done.

I'll tell you why.  Economically, a startup is best seen not as a way to get rich, but as a way to work faster.

But even to people who don't believe in gods, life commands respect.  There are times in most of our lives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has a sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious.

That's too uncertain.  They win by locking competitors out of their sales channels.  If you do manage to threaten them, they're more likely to buy you than sue you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it indicate about a company's market position when they resort to filing patent lawsuits against smaller competitors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you read of big companies filing patent suits against smaller ones, it's usually a big company on the way down, grasping at straws.  For example, Unisys's attempts to enforce their patent on LZW compression.  When you see a big company threatening patent suits, sell.  When a company starts fighting over IP, it's a sign they've lost the real battle, for users."}]}

I got a call from a VP there asking if we'd like to license it.  I replied that I thought the patent was completely bogus, and would never hold up in court.  \"Ok,\" he replied.  \"So, are you guys hiring?\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges might a startup face as it grows and potentially goes public?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If your startup grows big enough, however, you'll start to get sued, no matter what you do.  If you go public, for example, you'll be sued by multiple patent trolls who hope you'll pay them off to go away.  More on them later."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the recommended approach to dealing with patent infringement concerns for startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In other words, no one will sue you for patent infringement till you have money, and once you have money, people will sue you whether they have grounds to or not.  So I advise fatalism.  Don't waste your time worrying about patent infringement.  You're probably violating a patent every time you tie your shoelaces.  At the start, at least, just worry about making something great and getting lots of users.  If you grow to the point where anyone considers you worth attacking, you're doing well."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do we recommend that startups apply for patents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We do advise the companies we fund to apply for patents, but not so they can sue competitors.  Successful startups either get bought or grow into big companies.  If a startup wants to grow into a big company, they should apply for patents to build up the patent portfolio they'll need to maintain an armed truce with other big companies.  If they want to get bought, they should apply for patents because patents are part of the mating dance with acquirers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence acquirers' decisions to buy startups instead of building their own solutions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most startups that succeed do it by getting bought, and most acquirers care about patents.  Startup acquisitions are usually a build-vs-buy decision for the acquirer.  Should we buy this little startup or build our own?  And two things, especially, make them decide not to build their own: if you already have a large and rapidly growing user base, and if you have a fairly solid patent application on critical parts of your software."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might large companies opt to acquire technology rather than develop it in-house?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a third reason big companies should prefer buying to building: that if they built their own, they'd screw it up.  But few big companies are smart enough yet to admit this to themselves.  It's usually the acquirer's engineers who are asked how hard it would be for the company to build their own, and they overestimate their abilities."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does obtaining a patent influence a company's ability to protect and differentiate its technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A patent seems to change the balance.  It gives the acquirer an excuse to admit they couldn't copy what you're doing. It may also help them to grasp what's special about your technology."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the impact of patents on the software industry, according to the author's observations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Frankly, it surprises me how small a role patents play in the software business.  It's kind of ironic, considering all the dire things experts say about software patents stifling innovation, but when one looks closely at the software business, the most striking thing is how little patents seem to matter."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What legal actions can companies take against competitors in response to perceived technological advancements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In other fields, companies regularly sue competitors for patent infringement.  For example, the airport baggage scanning business was for many years a cozy duopoly shared between two companies, InVision and L-3.  In 2002 a startup called Reveal appeared, with new technology that let them build scanners a third the size.  They were sued for patent infringement before they'd even released a product."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an example of a major company filing a patent lawsuit against a smaller startup, and what might have motivated that decision?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You rarely hear that kind of story in our world.  The one example I've found is, embarrassingly enough, Yahoo, which filed a patent suit against a gaming startup called Xfire in 2005.  Xfire doesn't seem to be a very big deal, and it's hard to say why Yahoo felt threatened.  Xfire's VP of engineering had worked at Yahoo on similar stuff-- in fact, he was listed as an inventor on the patent Yahoo sued over-- so perhaps there was something personal about it.  My guess is that someone at Yahoo goofed.  At any rate they didn't pursue the suit very vigorously."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might patents in software be considered less valuable compared to patents in other engineering fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One is that software is so complicated that patents by themselves are not worth very much.  I may be maligning other fields here, but it seems that in most types of engineering you can hand the details of some new technique to a group of medium-high quality people and get the desired result.  For example, if someone develops a new process for smelting ore that gets a better yield, and you assemble a team of qualified experts and tell them about it, they'll be able to get the same yield.  This doesn't seem to work in software. Software is so subtle and unpredictable that \"qualified experts\" don't get you very far."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might a team of qualified experts struggle against a team of less experienced but highly motivated individuals in software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's why we rarely hear phrases like \"qualified expert\" in the software business.  What that level of ability can get you is, say, to make your software compatible with some other piece of software-- in eight months, at enormous cost.  To do anything harder you need individual brilliance.  If you assemble a team of qualified experts and tell them to make a new web-based email program, they'll get their asses kicked by a team of inspired nineteen year olds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What makes design a skill that can be developed and understood, similar to how electricity was once perceived?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But design is a definite skill.  It's not just an airy intangible. Things always seem intangible when you don't understand them. Electricity seemed an airy intangible to most people in 1800.  Who knew there was so much to know about it?  So it is with design. Some people are good at it and some people are bad at it, and there's something very tangible they're good or bad at."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is design particularly important in software development compared to physical product development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason design counts so much in software is probably that there are fewer constraints than on physical things.  Building physical things is expensive and dangerous.  The space of possible choices is smaller; you tend to have to work as part of a larger group; and you're subject to a lot of regulations.  You don't have any of that if you and a couple friends decide to create a new web-based application."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the success of small software companies against larger competitors beyond patents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because there's so much scope for design in software, a successful application tends to be way more than the sum of its patents.  What protects little companies from being copied by bigger competitors is not just their patents, but the thousand little things the big company will get wrong if they try."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do startups typically compete with established companies in the software industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The second reason patents don't count for much in our world is that startups rarely attack big companies head-on, the way Reveal did. In the software business, startups beat established companies by transcending them.  Startups don't build desktop word processing programs to compete with Microsoft Word."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do large companies typically respond to startup competition, and what implications does this have for the startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fortunately for startups, big companies are extremely good at denial. If you take the trouble to attack them from an oblique angle, they'll meet you half-way and maneuver to keep you in their blind spot.  To sue a startup would mean admitting it was dangerous, and that often means seeing something the big company doesn't want to see.  IBM used to sue its mainframe competitors regularly, but they didn't bother much about the microcomputer industry because they didn't want to see the threat it posed.  Companies building web based apps are similarly protected from Microsoft, which even now doesn't want to imagine a world in which Windows is irrelevant."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the principle-driven behavior of good hackers in the software industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good hackers care a lot about matters of principle, and they are highly mobile.  If a company starts misbehaving, smart people won't work there.  For some reason this seems to be more true in software than other businesses.  I don't think it's because hackers have intrinsically higher principles so much as that their skills are easily transferrable.  Perhaps we can split the difference and say that mobility gives hackers the luxury of being principled."}]}

It's very constraining in some ways.  If Google does do something evil, they get doubly whacked for it: once for whatever they did, and again for hypocrisy.  But I think it's worth it.  It helps them to hire the best people, and it's better, even from a purely selfish point of view, to be constrained by principles than by stupidity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is there limited legal action among software companies despite the prevalence of patents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not sure what the proportions are of the preceding three ingredients, but the custom among the big companies seems to be not to sue the small ones, and the startups are mostly too busy and too poor to sue one another.  So despite the huge number of software patents there's not a lot of suing going on.  With one exception: patent trolls."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are patent trolls and why are they viewed negatively in the tech industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Patent trolls are companies consisting mainly of lawyers whose whole business is to accumulate patents and threaten to sue companies who actually make things.  Patent trolls, it seems safe to say, are evil.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do patent trolls resemble historical practices of wealth extraction from merchants?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What companies like Forgent do is actually the proto-industrial way.  In the period just before the industrial revolution, some of the greatest fortunes in countries like England and France were made by courtiers who extracted some lucrative right from the crown-- like the right to collect taxes on the import of silk-- and then used this to squeeze money from the merchants in that business.  So when people compare patent trolls to the mafia, they're more right than they know, because the mafia too are not merely bad, but bad specifically in the sense of being an obsolete business model."}]}

In the last couple years they've extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from them.  Patent trolls are hard to fight precisely because they create nothing.  Big companies are safe from being sued by other big companies because they can threaten a counter-suit.  But because patent trolls don't make anything, there's nothing they can be sued for.  I predict this loophole will get closed fairly quickly, at least by legal standards.  It's clearly an abuse of the system, and the victims are powerful."}]}

With patents, central governments said, in effect, if you tell everyone your idea, we'll protect it for you.  There is a parallel here to the rise of civil order, which happened at roughly the same time. Before central governments were powerful enough to enforce order, rich people had private armies.  As governments got more powerful, they gradually compelled magnates to cede most responsibility for protecting them.

That last type, I'd argue, is good procrastination."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What types of tasks are considered \"small stuff\" that are unlikely to be remembered after one's death?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What's \"small stuff?\"  Roughly, work that has zero chance of being mentioned in your obituary.  It's hard to say at the time what will turn out to be your best work (will it be your magnum opus on Sumerian temple architecture, or the detective thriller you wrote under a pseudonym?), but there's a whole class of tasks you can safely rule out: shaving, doing your laundry, cleaning the house, writing thank-you notes—anything that might be called an errand."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might it be necessary to be assertive or ruthless when trying to accomplish important tasks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good in a sense, at least.  The people who want you to do the errands won't think it's good.  But you probably have to annoy them if you want to get anything done.  The mildest seeming people, if they want to do real work, all have a certain degree of ruthlessness when it comes to avoiding errands."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the consequences of procrastinating on certain types of errands?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some errands, like replying to letters, go away if you ignore them (perhaps taking friends with them).  Others, like mowing the lawn, or filing tax returns, only get worse if you put them off.  In principle it shouldn't work to put off the second kind of errand.  You're going to have to do whatever it is eventually.  Why not (as past-due notices are always saying) do it now?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might it be beneficial to postpone errands in favor of focusing on a creative project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason it pays to put off even those errands is that real work needs two things errands don't: big chunks of time, and the right mood.  If you get inspired by some project, it can be a net win to blow off everything you were supposed to do for the next few days to work on it.  Yes, those errands may cost you more time when you finally get around to them.  But if you get a lot done during those few days, you will be net more productive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of uninterrupted work time in achieving creative success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, it may not be a difference in degree, but a difference in kind.  There may be types of work that can only be done in long, uninterrupted stretches, when inspiration hits, rather than dutifully in scheduled little slices.  Empirically it seems to be so.  When I think of the people I know who've done great things, I don't imagine them dutifully crossing items off to-do lists.  I imagine them sneaking off to work on some new idea."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does interrupting someone with synchronous tasks affect their productivity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Conversely, forcing someone to perform errands synchronously is bound to limit their productivity.  The cost of an interruption is not just the time it takes, but that it breaks the time on either side in half.  You probably only have to interrupt someone a couple times a day before they're unable to work on hard problems at all."}]}

The main reason may be that there's no one to interrupt them yet. In theory it's good when the founders finally get enough money to hire people to do some of the work for them.  But it may be better to be overworked than interrupted.  Once you dilute a startup with ordinary office workers—with type-B procrastinators—the whole company starts to resonate at their frequency.  They're interrupt-driven, and soon you are too."}]}

Someone who has decided to write a novel, for example, will suddenly find that the house needs cleaning. People who fail to write novels don't do it by sitting in front of a blank page for days without writing anything.  They do it by feeding the cat, going out to buy something they need for their apartment, meeting a friend for coffee, checking email.  \"I don't have time to work,\" they say.

Why?  Why is it so hard to work on big problems?  One reason is that you may not get any reward in the forseeable future.

Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups they want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't want anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR departments.

As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend to be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would prefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, while the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter."}]}

Perhaps it's not just that hackers understand technology better, but that they're driven by more powerful motivations. Microsoft, as I've said before, is a dangerously misleading example. Their mean corporate culture only works for monopolies. Google is a better model."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do founders often feel fearful of competitors when starting their businesses?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Considering that the summer founders are the sharks in this ocean, we were surprised how frightened most of them were of competitors. But now that I think of it, we were just as frightened when we started Viaweb.  For the first year, our initial reaction to news of a competitor was always: we're doomed.  Just as a hypochondriac magnifies his symptoms till he's convinced he has some terrible disease, when you're not used to competitors you magnify them into monsters."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are competitors usually not as threatening to startups as they might appear?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's a handy rule for startups: competitors are rarely as dangerous as they seem.

[1I can imagine an advocate of \"best practices\" saying these ought to be considered from the start.  And he'd be right, except that they interfere with the primary function of software in a startup: to be a vehicle for experimenting with its own design.  Having to retrofit internationalization or scalability is a pain, certainly. The only bigger pain is not needing to, because your initial version was too big and rigid to evolve into something users wanted."}]}

That turned out to vary a lot.  Some we helped with technical advice-- for example, about how to set up an application to run on multiple servers.  Most we helped with strategy questions, like what to patent, and what to charge for and what to give away. Nearly all wanted advice about dealing with future investors: how much money should they take and what kind of terms should they expect?"}]}

The weekend before the demo day for investors, we had a practice session where all the groups gave their presentations. They were all terrible.  We tried to explain how to make them better, but we didn't have much hope.

Among other things, incubators usually make you work in their office-- that's where the word \"incubator\" comes from.  That seems the wrong model.  If investors get too involved, they smother one of the most powerful forces in a startup: the feeling that it's your own company."}]}

There's still debate about whether this was because of the Bubble, or because they're a bad idea.  My vote is they're a bad idea.  I think they fail because they select for the wrong people.  When we were starting a startup, we would never have taken funding from an \"incubator.\" We can find office space, thanks; just give us the money.

You have to get it from the rich."}]}

You could help the poor become more productive — for example, by improving access to education.  Instead of taking money from engineers and giving it to checkout clerks, you could enable people who would have become checkout clerks to become engineers."}]}

But the evidence of the last 200 years shows that it doesn't reduce economic inequality, because it makes the rich richer too.  If there are more engineers, then there are more opportunities to hire them and to sell them things.  Henry Ford couldn't have made a fortune building cars in a society in which most people were still subsistence farmers; he would have had neither workers nor customers."}]}

What if one of your newly minted engineers gets ambitious and goes on to become another Bill Gates?  Economic inequality will be as bad as ever.  If you actually want to compress the gap between rich and poor, you have to push down on the top as well as pushing up on the bottom."}]}

You could try to decrease the productivity of the people who make the most money: make the best surgeons operate with their left hands, force popular actors to overeat, and so on.  But this approach is hard to implement.  The only practical solution is to let people do the best work they can, and then (either by taxation or by limiting what they can charge) to confiscate whatever you deem to be surplus."}]}

A startup is like a small boat in the open sea.  One big wave and you're sunk.

If there is a safe option, that's the one a bureaucrat will choose.   But that is exactly the wrong way to do venture investing.  The nature of the business means that you want to make terribly risky choices, if the upside looks good enough."}]}

If I'd been forbidden to make enough from a startup to do this, I would have sought security by some other means: for example, by going to work for a big, stable organization from which it would be hard to get fired.

I'm heading for a conclusion to which many readers will have to be dragged kicking and screaming, so I've tried to make each link unbreakable.  Decreasing economic inequality means taking money from the rich.  Since risk and reward are equivalent, decreasing potential rewards automatically decreases people's appetite for risk.  Startups are intrinsically risky.  Without the prospect of rewards proportionate to the risk, founders will not invest their time in a startup.  Founders are irreplaceable.  So eliminating economic inequality means eliminating startups."}]}

It's the engine that drives them, in the same way a fall of water drives a water mill.  People start startups in the hope of becoming much richer than they were before.

Startups yield faster growth at greater risk than established companies.  Does this trend also hold among startups? That is, are the riskiest startups the ones that generate most growth if they succeed?  I suspect the answer is yes.  And that's a chilling thought, because it means that if you cut investors' appetite for risk, the most beneficial startups are the first to go."}]}

If you made it so that people could only get rich by starting startups, people who wanted to get rich would all start startups.  And that might be a great thing.  But I don't think it would have much effect on the distribution of wealth. People who want to get rich will do whatever they have to.  If startups are the only way to do it, you'll just get far more people starting startups.  (If you write the laws very carefully, that is.

By 1969, when Ted Kennedy drove off the bridge at Chappaquiddick, the limit seemed to be down to one.  Today it may well be zero.  But what's changed is not variation in wealth.

Likewise, it's obvious empirically that a country that doesn't let people get rich is headed for disaster, whether it's Diocletian's Rome or Harold Wilson's Britain.  But I did not till recently understand the role risk played."}]}

So if you suppress variation in wealth, seniority will become correspondingly more important.  So far, I know of no counterexamples, though in very corrupt countries you may get both simultaneously.

That's less the rule now.  Our generation wants to get paid up front.  Instead of developing a product for some big company in the expectation of getting job security in return, we develop the product ourselves, in a startup, and sell it to the big company. At the very least we want options."}]}

But really the two cases are not as different as they look in economic statistics."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do economic statistics fail to accurately represent wealth disparities in socialist countries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Economic statistics are misleading because they ignore the value of safe jobs.  An easy job from which one can't be fired is worth money; exchanging the two is one of the commonest forms of corruption.  A sinecure is, in effect, an annuity.  Except sinecures don't appear in economic statistics.  If they did, it would be clear that in practice socialist countries have nontrivial disparities of wealth, because they usually have a class of powerful bureaucrats who are paid mostly by seniority and can never be fired."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the value of a position on the corporate ladder in large companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While not a sinecure, a position on the corporate ladder was genuinely valuable, because big companies tried not to fire people, and promoted from within based largely on seniority.  A position on the corporate ladder had a value analogous to the \"goodwill\" that is a very real element in the valuation of companies.  It meant one could expect future high paying jobs."}]}

It's not only economic statistics that ignore the value of safe jobs.  Corporate balance sheets do too.  One reason it was profitable to carve up 1980s companies and sell them for parts was that they hadn't formally acknowledged their implicit debt to employees who had done good work and expected to be rewarded with high-paying executive jobs when their time came."}]}

For one thing, it seems a bad plan to treat jobs as rewards.  Plenty of good engineers got made into bad managers that way.

But maybe the older generation would laugh at me for saying that the way we do things is riskier.  After all, projects within big companies were always getting cancelled as a result of arbitrary decisions from higher up.  My father's entire industry (breeder reactors) disappeared that way."}]}

Like open source hackers, bloggers compete with people working for money, and often win.  The method of ensuring quality is also the same: Darwinian.  Companies ensure quality through rules to prevent employees from screwing up.  But you don't need that when the audience can communicate with one another.  People just produce whatever they want; the good stuff spreads, and the bad gets ignored.  And in both cases, feedback from the audience improves the best work."}]}

As societies get richer, they learn something about work that's a lot like what they learn about diet.  We know now that the healthiest diet is the one our peasant ancestors were forced to eat because they were poor.  Like rich food, idleness only seems desirable when you don't get enough of it.  I think we were designed to work, just as we were designed to eat a certain amount of fiber, and we feel bad if we don't."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the perception of superiority between professional journalists and amateur commentators?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was the narrowness of such channels that made professionals seem so superior to amateurs.  There were only a few jobs as professional journalists, for example, so competition ensured the average journalist was fairly good.  Whereas anyone can express opinions about current events in a bar.  And so the average person expressing his opinions in a bar sounds like an idiot compared to a journalist writing about the subject."}]}

You don't have to buy a drink, and they even let kids in. Millions of people are publishing online, and the average level of what they're writing, as you might expect, is not very good.

What they mean by \"blogger\" is not someone who publishes in a weblog format, but anyone who publishes online. That's going to become a problem as the Web becomes the default medium for publication.  So I'd like to suggest an alternative word for someone who publishes online. How about \"writer?\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are traditional print media competing against in the digital age?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "blog.  In the old world of channels, it meant something to talk about average quality, because that's what you were getting whether you liked it or not. But now you can read any writer you want.

For example, the president notices that a majority of voters now think invading Iraq was a mistake, so he makes an address to the nation to drum up support.  Where is the man bites dog in that?

A child is abducted; there's a tornado; a ferry sinks; someone gets bitten by a shark; a small plane crashes.  And what do you learn about the world from these stories?  Absolutely nothing.  They're outlying data points; what makes them gripping also makes them irrelevant."}]}

That may not seem surprising.  But it should be.  It's the architectural equivalent of a home-made aircraft shooting down an F-18.  Companies spend millions to build office buildings for a single purpose: to be a place to work.  And yet people working in their own homes, which aren't even designed to be workplaces, end up being more productive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the inefficiency of the average office environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This proves something a lot of us have suspected.  The average office is a miserable place to get work done.  And a lot of what makes offices bad are the very qualities we associate with professionalism.  The sterility of offices is supposed to suggest efficiency.  But suggesting efficiency is a different thing from actually being efficient."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the workplace atmosphere affect productivity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The atmosphere of the average workplace is to productivity what flames painted on the side of a car are to speed.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some characteristics of the work environment in a startup compared to a traditional office?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Things are different in a startup.  Often as not a startup begins in an apartment.  Instead of matching beige cubicles they have an assortment of furniture they bought used.  They work odd hours, wearing the most casual of clothing.  They look at whatever they want online without worrying whether it's \"work safe.\" The cheery, bland language of the office is replaced by wicked humor.  And you know what?  The company at this stage is probably the most productive it's ever going to be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key drawback of traditional office work hours according to the author?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To me the most demoralizing aspect of the traditional office is that you're supposed to be there at certain times.  There are usually a few people in a company who really have to, but the reason most employees work fixed hours is that the company can't measure their productivity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the rationale behind enforcing office hours in the workplace?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The basic idea behind office hours is that if you can't make people work, you can at least prevent them from having fun.  If employees have to be in the building a certain number of hours a day, and are forbidden to do non-work things while there, then they must be working.  In theory.  In practice they spend a lot of their time in a no-man's land, where they're neither working nor having fun."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of measuring work output on traditional work schedules?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you could measure how much work people did, many companies wouldn't need any fixed workday. You could just say: this is what you have to do.  Do it whenever you like, wherever you like.  If your work requires you to talk to other people in the company, then you may need to be here a certain amount.  Otherwise we don't care."}]}

I'm convinced the facetime model is the main reason large organizations have so many meetings. Per capita, large organizations accomplish very little. And yet all those people have to be on site at least eight hours a day.  When so much time goes in one end and so little achievement comes out the other, something has to give.  And meetings are the main mechanism for taking up the slack."}]}

I was very aware, because of the novelty, that I was being paid for programming.  It seemed just amazing, as if there was a machine on my desk that spat out a dollar bill every two minutes no matter what I did.  Even while I was in the bathroom!  But because the imaginary machine was always running, I felt I always ought to be working. And so meetings felt wonderfully relaxing.  They counted as work, just like programming, but they were so much easier. All you had to do was sit and look attentive."}]}

So for big companies I propose the following experiment. Set aside one day where meetings are forbidden-- where everyone has to sit at their desk all day and work without interruption on things they can do without talking to anyone else. Some amount of communication is necessary in most jobs, but I'm sure many employees could find eight hours worth of stuff they could do by themselves.  You could call it \"Work Day.\""}]}

A friend asked what they were doing for office space, and seemed surprised when I said we expected them to work out of whatever apartments they found to live in.  But we didn't propose that to save money.  We did it because we want their software to be good.  Working in crappy informal spaces is one of the things startups do right without realizing it.  As soon as you get into an office, work and life start to drift apart."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do open source and blogging demonstrate the value of grassroots innovation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The third big lesson we can learn from open source and blogging is that ideas can bubble up from the bottom, instead of flowing down from the top.  Open source and blogging both work bottom-up: people make what they want, and the best stuff prevails."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do open source projects and blogs compare to traditional companies in terms of operational principles?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Does this sound familiar?  It's the principle of a market economy. Ironically, though open source and blogs are done for free, those worlds resemble market economies, while most companies, for all their talk about the value of free markets, are run internally like communist states."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two main forces that influence design in the channel era?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two forces that together steer design: ideas about what to do next, and the enforcement of quality.  In the channel era, both flowed down from the top.  For example, newspaper editors assigned stories to reporters, then edited what they wrote."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do open source and blogging challenge traditional notions of quality and idea enforcement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Open source and blogging show us things don't have to work that way.  Ideas and even the enforcement of quality can flow bottom-up. And in both cases the results are not merely acceptable, but better. For example, open source software is more reliable precisely because it's open source; anyone can find mistakes."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did the author prefer the idea of their work being rejected by the magazine editor?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "that seemed suitable for a magazine, so I sent it to an editor I know. As I was waiting to hear back, I found to my surprise that I was hoping they'd reject it.  Then I could put it online right away.

How many of us have heard stories of employees going to management and saying, please let us build this thing to make money for you-- and the company saying no?  The most famous example is probably Steve Wozniak, who originally wanted to build microcomputers for his then-employer, HP. And they turned him down.  On the blunderometer, this episode ranks with IBM accepting a non-exclusive license for DOS.  But I think this happens all the time.  We just don't hear about it usually, because to prove yourself right you have to quit and start your own company, like Wozniak did."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key lessons that open source and blogging can teach businesses about productivity and management?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So these, I think, are the three big lessons open source and blogging have to teach business: (1) that people work harder on stuff they like, (2) that the standard office environment is very unproductive, and (3) that bottom-up often works better than top-down."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can understanding employee productivity in different work environments impact project deadlines?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can imagine managers at this point saying: what is this guy talking about?

When I say business can learn from open source, I don't mean any specific business can.  I mean business can learn about new conditions the same way a gene pool does.  I'm not claiming companies can get smarter, just that dumb ones will die."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might the traditional employer-employee relationship evolve in a future influenced by open source and blogging principles?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So what will business look like when it has assimilated the lessons of open source and blogging?  I think the big obstacle preventing us from seeing the future of business is the assumption that people working for you have to be employees.  But think about what's going on underneath:  the company has some money, and they pay it to the employee in the hope that he'll make something worth more than they paid him.  Well, there are other ways to arrange that relationship. Instead of paying the guy money as a salary, why not give it to him as investment?

The main reason PR firms exist is that reporters are lazy.  Or, to put it more nicely, overworked.  Really they ought to be out there digging up stories for themselves.

Once you know how to read them, it's straightforward to figure out who the client is.  With trend stories, PR firms usually line up one or more \"experts\" to talk about the industry generally. In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney."}]}

So they want the fund to be huge-- hundreds of millions of dollars, if possible. But that means each partner ends up being responsible for investing a lot of money.

Experienced founders treat it as a cost of doing business.  Either way it sucks.  But again, the only reason VCs are so sneaky is the giant deals they do.  With so much at stake, they have to be devious."}]}

Like steroids, these sudden huge investments can do more harm than good.  Google survived enormous VC funding because it could legitimately absorb large amounts of money.

If our competitor had done that, the last round of investors would presumably have lost money.  I assume they could have vetoed such a deal.  But no one those days was paying a lot more than Yahoo.

And most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius.

Bush?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But when I think about why I voted for Clinton over the first George Bush, it wasn't because I was shifting to the left.  Clinton just seemed more dynamic.

The most recent counterexample appears to be 1968, when Nixon beat the more charismatic Hubert Humphrey.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did Nixon choose not to participate in televised debates against Humphrey?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ", Nixon knew he had less charisma than Humphrey, and thus simply refused to debate him on TV.

But in 1968 the custom of televised debates was still evolving.  In effect, Nixon won in 1968 because voters were never allowed to see the real Nixon.  All they saw were carefully scripted campaign spots."}]}

The core of the Democrats' ideology seems to be a belief in government.  Perhaps this tends to attract people who are earnest, but dull.  Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry were so similar in that respect that they might have been brothers.  Good thing for the Democrats that their screen lets through an occasional Clinton, even if some scandal results."}]}

And yet, if they are, we have a remarkable coincidence to explain.  In every presidential election since TV became widespread, the apparently more charismatic candidate has won.

The phenomenon is like a pricing anomaly; once people realize it's there, it will disappear.  Once both parties realize it's a waste of time to nominate uncharismatic candidates, they'll tend to nominate only the most charismatic ones.  And if the candidates are equally charismatic, charisma will cancel out, and elections will be decided on issues, as political commentators like to think they are now."}]}

Charismatic candidates will tend to have more skeletons than squeaky clean dullards, but in practice that doesn't seem to lose elections. The current Bush, for example, probably did more drugs in his twenties than any preceding president, and yet managed to get elected with a base of evangelical Christians.

The source of the problem may be a variant of the Bradley Effect.

Because some people don't respond.  To get a truly random sample, pollsters ask, say, every 20th person leaving the polling place who they voted for.  But not everyone wants to answer.

Because people in the US are more conservative than they're willing to admit.  The values of the elite in this country, at least at the moment, are NPR values.

This seems to me the leading theory to explain why the exit polls were so far off this year.  NPR values said one ought to vote for Kerry.  So all the people who voted for Kerry felt virtuous for doing so, and were eager to tell pollsters they had. No one who voted for Kerry did it as an act of quiet defiance."}]}

The answer, of course, is that the raison d'etre of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaelogy that does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.

After all, the average public high school student gets zero exposure to his artistic heritage.  No disaster results. The people who are interested in art learn about it for themselves, and those who aren't don't.  I find that American adults are no better or worse informed about literature than art, despite the fact that they spent years studying literature in high school and no time at all studying art.

I love to read more than anything, but by the end of high school I never read the books we were assigned.

Investors looked at Yahoo's earnings and said to themselves, here is proof that Internet companies can make money.  So they invested in new startups that promised to be the next Yahoo.  And as soon as these startups got the money, what did they do with it? Buy millions of dollars worth of advertising on Yahoo to promote their brand.

The tiny, expensive pipeline to consumers was tellingly named \"the channel.\" Control the channel and you could feed them what you wanted, on your terms.

The hard part, if you want to win by making the best stuff, is the beginning.  Eventually everyone will learn by word of mouth that you're the best, but how do you survive to that point?  And it is in this crucial stage that the Internet has the most effect.  First, the Internet lets anyone find you at almost zero cost. Second, it dramatically speeds up the rate at which reputation spreads by word of mouth.  Together these mean that in many fields the rule will be: Build it, and they will come.

So what's the connection between nerds and technology? Roughly that you can't fool mother nature. In technical matters, you have to get the right answers.

Nerds are already a lot cooler than they were when I was a kid.  When I was in college in the mid-1980s, \"nerd\" was still an insult.

Not surprisingly, people do what you pay them to. If you pay them by the hour, they'll work a lot of hours.

Our standards about how many employees a company should have are still influenced by old patterns.  Startups are perforce small, because they can't afford to hire a lot of people.

Certainly schools should teach students how to write.  But due to a series of historical accidents the teaching of writing has gotten mixed together with the study of literature.

To answer that we have to go back almost a thousand years.  Around 1100, Europe at last began to catch its breath after centuries of chaos, and once they had the luxury of curiosity they rediscovered what we call \"the classics.\"  The effect was rather as if we were visited by beings from another solar system. These earlier civilizations were so much more sophisticated that for the next several centuries the main work of European scholars, in almost every field, was to assimilate what they knew."}]}

It seemed the essence of what scholars did.  As European scholarship gained momentum it became less and less important; by 1350 someone who wanted to learn about science could find better teachers than Aristotle in his own era.

The answer, of course, is that the original raison d'etre of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaeology that does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors. But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer. The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that those studying the classics were, if not wasting their time, at least working on problems of minor importance."}]}

This idea (along with the PhD, the department, and indeed the whole concept of the modern university) was imported from Germany in the late 19th century. Beginning at Johns Hopkins in 1876, the new model spread rapidly."}]}

Colleges had long taught English composition.  But how do you do research on composition? The professors who taught math could be required to do original math, the professors who taught history could be required to write scholarly articles about history, but what about the professors who taught rhetoric or composition?

The seeds of our miserable high school experiences were sown in 1892, when the National Education Association \"formally recommended that literature and composition be unified in the high school course.\" [4The 'riting component of the 3 Rs then morphed into English, with the bizarre consequence that high school students now had to write about English literature-- to write, without even realizing it, imitations of whatever English professors had been publishing in their journals a few decades before."}]}

In fact they were more law schools.  And at least in our tradition lawyers are advocates, trained to take either side of an argument and make as good a case for it as they can. Whether cause or effect, this spirit pervaded early universities.  The study of rhetoric, the art of arguing persuasively, was a third of the undergraduate curriculum. [5And after the lecture the most common form of discussion was the disputation.  This is at least nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense: most people treat the words thesis and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least, a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was the argument by which one defended it."}]}

The topic sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the conclusion-- uh, what is the conclusion?  I was never sure about that in high school.  It seemed as if we were just supposed to restate what we said in the first paragraph, but in different enough words that no one could tell. Why bother? But when you understand the origins of this sort of \"essay,\" you can see where the conclusion comes from.  It's the concluding remarks to the jury."}]}

When I give a draft of an essay to friends, there are two things I want to know: which parts bore them, and which seem unconvincing.  The boring bits can usually be fixed by cutting.  But I don't try to fix the unconvincing bits by arguing more cleverly.  I need to talk the matter over."}]}

In that case, in the course of the conversation I'll be forced to come up a with a clearer explanation, which I can just incorporate in the essay.  More often than not I have to change what I was saying as well. But the aim is never to be convincing per se.

And so you can't begin with a thesis, because you don't have one, and may never have one.  An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a question.

Just as inviting people over forces you to clean up your apartment, writing something that other people will read forces you to think well.  So it does matter to have an audience.

Particularly the sort written by the staff writers of newsmagazines.  Outside writers tend to supply editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which make a beeline toward a rousing (and foreordained) conclusion.   But the staff writers feel obliged to write something \"balanced.\" Since they're writing for a popular magazine, they start with the most radioactively controversial questions, from which-- because they're writing for a popular magazine-- they then proceed to recoil in terror.

An essay has to come up with answers. They don't always, of course.  Sometimes you start with a promising question and get nowhere.  But those you don't publish.

One possible exception might be things that have deliberately had all the variation sucked out of them, like working in fast food.  In retrospect, was there anything interesting about working at Baskin-Robbins? Well, it was interesting how important color was to the customers.  Kids a certain age would point into the case and say that they wanted yellow.  Did they want French Vanilla or Lemon?  They would just look at you blankly.  They wanted yellow.

For example, everyone I've talked to while writing this essay felt the same about English classes-- that the whole process seemed pointless.

The important thing for our purposes is that, as a result, a well brought-up teenage kid's brain is a more or less complete collection of all our taboos — and in mint condition, because they're untainted by experience.

It could be that the scientists are simply smarter; most physicists could, if necessary, make it through a PhD program in French literature, but few professors of French literature could make it through a PhD program in physics.  Or it could be because it's clearer in the sciences whether theories are true or false, and this makes scientists bolder.

Indeed, this solution neatly mirrors the problem.  The problem with spam is that in order to reach a few gullible people the spammer sends mail to everyone.  The non-gullible recipients are merely collateral damage.  But the non-gullible majority won't stop getting spam until they can stop (or threaten to stop) the gullible from responding to it.

They happily set to work proving theorems like the other mathematicians over in the math department, and probably soon stop noticing that the building they work in says ``computer science'' on the outside.  But for the hackers this label is a problem. If what they're doing is called science, it makes them feel they ought to be acting scientific.

Over time, beautiful things tend to thrive, and ugly things tend to get discarded.  Unfortunately, the amounts of time involved can be longer than human lifetimes.

A worse danger is that you will yourself misunderstand your work.  Related fields are where you go looking for ideas.  If you find yourself in the computer science department, there is a natural temptation to believe, for example, that hacking is the applied version of what theoretical computer science is the theory of.

Worse still, instead of patiently writing out a complete program and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew out code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into shape.

Only a small percentage of hackers can actually design software, and it's hard for the people running a company to pick these out.

Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters.  But when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low.

These opportunities are not easy to find, though. It's hard to engage a big company in a design war, just as it's hard to engage an opponent inside a castle in hand to hand combat.  It would be pretty easy to write a better word processor than Microsoft Word, for example, but Microsoft, within the castle of their operating system monopoly, probably wouldn't even notice if you did."}]}

That's where you can win big by taking the bold approach to design, and having the same people both design and implement the product. Microsoft themselves did this at the start.  So did Apple. And Hewlett-Packard.  I suspect almost every successful startup has."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges might software developers face when working in a startup environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So one way to build great software is to start your own startup.  There are two problems with this, though.  One is that in a startup you have to do so much besides write software. At Viaweb I considered myself lucky if I got to hack a quarter of the time.  And the things I had to do the other three quarters of the time ranged from tedious to terrifying.  I have a benchmark for this, because I once had to leave a board meeting to have some cavities filled.  I remember sitting back in the dentist's chair, waiting for the drill, and feeling like I was on vacation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do startups face in aligning profitable software development with engaging programming tasks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other problem with startups is that there is not much overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the kind that's interesting to write.  Programming languages are interesting to write, and Microsoft's first product was one, in fact, but no one will pay for programming languages now.  If you want to make money, you tend to be forced to work on problems that are too nasty for anyone to solve for free."}]}

Prices are determined by supply and demand, and there is just not as much demand for things that are fun to work on as there is for things that solve the mundane problems of individual customers. Acting in off-Broadway plays just doesn't pay as well as wearing a gorilla suit in someone's booth at a trade show.  Writing novels doesn't pay as well as writing ad copy for garbage disposals.

At Viaweb, we would have been reluctant to hire anyone who didn't.  When we interviewed programmers, the main thing we cared about was what kind of software they wrote in their spare time.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can observing a painter's body of work reveal their artistic development and learning process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because painters leave a trail of work behind them, you can watch them learn by doing.  If you look at the work of a painter in chronological order, you'll find that each painting builds on things that have been learned in previous ones.  When there's something in a painting that works very well, you can usually find version 1 of it in a smaller form in some earlier painting."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might hackers benefit from adopting the creative processes of painters and other makers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think most makers work this way.  Writers and architects seem to as well.  Maybe it would be good for hackers to act more like painters, and regularly start over from scratch, instead of continuing to work for years on one project, and trying to incorporate all their later ideas as revisions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the learning processes of hackers and scientists differ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fact that hackers learn to hack by doing it is another sign of how different hacking is from the sciences.  Scientists don't learn science by doing it, but by doing labs and problem sets. Scientists start out doing work that's perfect, in the sense that they're just trying to reproduce work someone else has already done for them. Eventually, they get to the point where they can do original work. Whereas hackers, from the start, are doing original work; it's just very bad.  So hackers start original, and get good, and scientists start good, and get original."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do painters enhance their skills through the study of master works?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other way makers learn is from examples. For a painter, a museum is a reference library of techniques. For hundreds of years it has been part of the traditional education of painters to copy the works of the great masters, because copying forces you to look closely at the way a painting is made."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do writers often develop their writing skills?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Writers do this too. Benjamin Franklin learned to write by summarizing the points in the essays of Addison and Steele and then trying to reproduce them.  Raymond Chandler did the same thing with detective stories."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the open-source movement impacted the learning process for new programmers compared to previous methods?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at good programs-- not just at what they do, but the source code too.  One of the less publicized benefits of the open-source movement is that it has made it easier to learn to program.  When I learned to program, we had to rely mostly on examples in books.  The one big chunk of code available then was Unix, but even this was not open source.  Most of the people who read the source read it in illicit photocopies of John Lions' book, which though written in 1977 was not allowed to be published until 1996."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the process of creating a painting illustrate the concept of gradual refinement and adaptation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another example we can take from painting is the way that paintings are created by gradual refinement.  Paintings usually begin with a sketch. Gradually the details get filled in. But it is not merely a process of filling in. Sometimes the original plans turn out to be mistaken. Countless paintings, when you look at them in xrays, turn out to have limbs that have been moved or facial features that have been readjusted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the approach to programming benefit from lessons learned in painting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's a case where we can learn from painting.  I think hacking should work this way too.  It's unrealistic to expect that the specifications for a program will be perfect. You're better off if you admit this up front, and write programs in a way that allows specifications to change on the fly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the risk associated with making design decisions too early in the software development process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature optimization.  I think we should be just as worried about premature design-- deciding too early what a program should do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics should a programming language have to enhance flexibility and ease of decision-making?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The right tools can help us avoid this danger.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What aspect of Leonardo's work ethic is compared to Michael Jordan's dedication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not Leonardo.  How hard he worked on part of a painting didn't depend at all on how closely he expected anyone to look at it. He was like Michael Jordan.  Relentless."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do unseen details play in creating impactful art, according to the example of Ginevra de Benci?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Relentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details become visible. When people walk by the portrait of Ginevra de Benci, their attention is often immediately arrested by it, even before they look at the label and notice that it says Leonardo da Vinci.  All those unseen details combine to produce something that's just stunning, like a thousand barely audible voices all singing in tune."}]}

If you look inside good software, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too. I'm not claiming I write great software, but I know that when it comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way. It drives me crazy to see code that's badly indented, or that uses ugly variable names."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the role of a hacker differ between being an implementor and a creator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If a hacker were a mere implementor, turning a spec into code, then he could just work his way through it from one end to the other like someone digging a ditch.  But if the hacker is a creator, we have to take inspiration into account."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What similarities exist between the creative processes in hacking and painting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In hacking, like painting, work comes in cycles.  Sometimes you get excited about some new project and you want to work sixteen hours a day on it. Other times nothing seems interesting."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can managing different types of tasks help maintain productivity and prevent stagnation in creative work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To do good work you have to take these cycles into account, because they're affected by how you react to them. When you're driving a car with a manual transmission on a hill, you have to back off the clutch sometimes to avoid stalling.  Backing off can likewise prevent ambition from stalling. In both painting and hacking there are some tasks that are terrifyingly ambitious, and others that are comfortingly routine.  It's a good idea to save some easy tasks for moments when you would otherwise stall."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What aspects of debugging make it a uniquely enjoyable and straightforward experience in the context of hacking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In hacking, this can literally mean saving up bugs. I like debugging: it's the one time that hacking is as straightforward as people think it is.  You have a totally constrained problem, and all you have to do is solve it.  Your program is supposed to do x.  Instead it does y. Where does it go wrong? You know you're going to win in the end.  It's as relaxing as painting a wall."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What lessons can collaboration in art teach us about teamwork and individual contribution?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The example of painting can teach us not only how to manage our own work, but how to work together.

Michelangelo was considered especially dedicated for insisting on painting all the figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel himself."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did collaboration typically work among painters in a workshop?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As far as I know, when painters worked together on a painting, they never worked on the same parts.  It was common for the master to paint the principal figures and for assistants to paint the others and the background.  But you never had one guy painting over the work of another."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the recommended approach to collaboration in software development to prevent code from becoming unmanageable?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think this is the right model for collaboration in software too.  Don't push it too far.  When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four different people, no one of whom really owns it, it will end up being like a common-room.  It will tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft. The right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces between them that are as carefully designed and, if possible, as articulated as programming languages."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is empathy important for hackers when developing software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like painting, most software is intended for a human audience.  And so hackers, like painters, must have empathy to do really great work.  You have to be able to see things from the user's point of view."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did early experiences with empathy influence your perspective on it as an adult?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I was a kid I was always being told to look at things from someone else's point of view.  What this always meant in practice was to do what someone else wanted, instead of what I wanted.  This of course gave empathy a bad name, and I made a point of not cultivating it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key factor that contributes to success in understanding others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Boy, was I wrong.  It turns out that looking at things from other people's point of view is practically the secret of success.  It doesn't necessarily mean being self-sacrificing. Far from it.  Understanding how someone else sees things doesn't imply that you'll act in his interest; in some situations-- in war, for example-- you want to do exactly the opposite. [4]"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is understanding the audience important for creators?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most makers make things for a human audience. And to engage an audience you have to understand what they need. Nearly all the greatest paintings are paintings of people, for example, because people are what people are interested in."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does empathy play in distinguishing a good hacker from a great one?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one.  Some hackers are quite smart, but when it comes to empathy are practically solipsists.  It's hard for such people to design great software [5], because they can't see things from the user's point of view."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can someone's empathy be assessed in a technical conversation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to tell how good people are at empathy is to watch them explain a technical question to someone without a technical background.  We probably all know people who, though otherwise smart, are just comically bad at this.  If someone asks them at a dinner party what a programming language is, they'll say something like ``Oh, a high-level language is what the compiler uses as input to generate object code.'' High-level language?  Compiler?  Object code?  Someone who doesn't know what a programming language is obviously doesn't know what these things are, either."}]}

So to write good software you have to understand how little users understand. They're going to walk up to the software with no preparation, and it had better do what they guess it will, because they're not going to read the manual.  The best system I've ever seen in this respect was the original Macintosh, in 1985. It did what software almost never does: it just worked. [6]"}]}

I know several people who've sworn off Perl after such experiences. [7]"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is there a correlation between intelligence and empathy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lack of empathy is associated with intelligence, to the point that there is even something of a fashion for it in some places. But I don't think there's any correlation. You can do well in math and the natural sciences without having to learn empathy, and people in these fields tend to be smart, so the two qualities have come to be associated.  But there are plenty of dumb people who are bad at empathy too.  Just listen to the people who call in with questions on talk shows.

There is always a big time lag in prestige.  It's like light from a distant star. Painting has prestige now because of great work people did five hundred years ago.

At one point a competitor added a feature to their software that was basically useless, but since it was one of few they had that we didn't, they made much of it in the trade press.

Languages are notation.  A program is a formal description of the problem you want a computer to solve for you.

It was a classic \"metacircular\" interpreter written on top of Common Lisp, with a definite family resemblance to the eval function defined in McCarthy's original Lisp paper. The whole thing was only a couple hundred lines of code, so it was very easy to understand and change.  The Common Lisp we used, CLisp, itself runs on top of a byte code interpreter.  So here we had two levels of interpretation, one of them (the top one) shockingly inefficient, and the language was usable.  Barely usable, I admit, but usable."}]}

I expect that, as with the stupendous speed of the underlying hardware, parallelism will be something that is available if you ask for it explicitly, but ordinarily not used.  This implies that the kind of parallelism we have in a hundred years will not, except in special applications, be massive parallelism.

If someone had offered me the chance to be the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn't have taken it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Would many kids prefer to be socially accepted over being perceived as highly intelligent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Much as they suffer from their unpopularity, I don't think many nerds would. To them the thought of average intelligence is unbearable. But most kids would take that deal. For half of them, it would be a step up. Even for someone in the eightieth percentile (assuming, as everyone seemed to then, that intelligence is a scalar), who wouldn't drop thirty points in exchange for being loved and admired by everyone?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What internal conflict do nerds face in the context of American secondary schools?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And that, I think, is the root of the problem. Nerds serve two masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even more to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in your spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary school."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the dedication of American school kids to popularity compare to that of professionals in high-pressure fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that \"no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it.\" I wonder if anyone in the world works harder at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. They occasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies. An American teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a year."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do teenagers navigate social dynamics and conformity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't mean to suggest they do this consciously. Some of them truly are little Machiavellis, but what I really mean here is that teenagers are always on duty as conformists."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do teenagers place significant importance on their clothing and appearance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, teenage kids pay a great deal of attention to clothes. They don't consciously dress to be popular. They dress to look good. But to who? To the other kids. Other kids' opinions become their definition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everything they do, right down to the way they walk. And so every effort they make to do things \"right\" is also, consciously or not, an effort to be more popular."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to a person's popularity beyond inherent qualities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nerds don't realize this. They don't realize that it takes work to be popular. In general, people outside some very demanding field don't realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though often unconscious) effort. For example, most people seem to consider the ability to draw as some kind of innate quality, like being tall. In fact, most people who \"can draw\" like drawing, and have spent many hours doing it; that's why they're good at it. Likewise, popular isn't just something you are or you aren't, but something you make yourself."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are nerds often considered unpopular among their peers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about. Their attention is drawn to books or the natural world, not fashions and parties. They're like someone trying to play soccer while balancing a glass of water on his head. Other players who can focus their whole attention on the game beat them effortlessly, and wonder why they seem so incapable."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the upbringing and social training of nerds and popular kids differ in terms of their priorities and skills?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even if nerds cared as much as other kids about popularity, being popular would be more work for them. The popular kids learned to be popular, and to want to be popular, the same way the nerds learned to be smart, and to want to be smart: from their parents. While the nerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kids were being trained to please."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the perception of someone as a \"nerd\" in social contexts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So far I've been finessing the relationship between smart and nerd, using them as if they were interchangeable. In fact it's only the context that makes them so. A nerd is someone who isn't socially adept enough. But \"enough\" depends on where you are. In a typical American school, standards for coolness are so high (or at least, so specific) that you don't have to be especially awkward to look awkward by comparison."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the social challenges faced by smart kids during adolescence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires. Unless they also happen to be good-looking, natural athletes, or siblings of popular kids, they'll tend to become nerds. And that's why smart people's lives are worst between, say, the ages of eleven and seventeen. Life at that age revolves far more around popularity than before or after."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the influence of parents on children's lives change as they grow older?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Before that, kids' lives are dominated by their parents, not by other kids. Kids do care what their peers think in elementary school, but this isn't their whole life, as it later becomes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do children's social dynamics change around the age of eleven?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Around the age of eleven, though, kids seem to start treating their family as a day job. They create a new world among themselves, and standing in this world is what matters, not standing in their family. Indeed, being in trouble in their family can win them points in the world they care about."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges arise when children create their own social environments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The problem is, the world these kids create for themselves is at first a very crude one.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What message did the author feel was missed in the book they read in school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like a lot of American kids, I read this book in school. Presumably it was not a coincidence. Presumably someone wanted to point out to us that we were savages, and that we had made ourselves a cruel and stupid world. This was too subtle for me. While the book seemed entirely believable, I didn't get the additional message. I wish they had just told us outright that we were savages and our world was stupid."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does unpopularity affect the social experiences of nerds in school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nerds would find their unpopularity more bearable if it merely caused them to be ignored. Unfortunately, to be unpopular in school is to be actively persecuted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do teenage kids tend to persecute nerds while adults typically do not?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why? Once again, anyone currently in school might think this a strange question to ask. How could things be any other way? But they could be. Adults don't normally persecute nerds. Why do teenage kids do it?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some teenagers engage in cruel behavior towards their peers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Partly because teenagers are still half children, and many children are just intrinsically cruel. Some torture nerds for the same reason they pull the legs off spiders. Before you develop a conscience, torture is amusing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological factors contribute to bullying behavior among children, particularly towards those they perceive as weaker?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feel better. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below. I've read that this is why poor whites in the United States are the group most hostile to blacks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do alliances and common enemies play in the dynamics of popularity among children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it's part of the mechanism of popularity. Popularity is only partially about individual attractiveness. It's much more about alliances. To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people closer than a common enemy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do groups tend to bully more effectively than individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times at home, you can create an enemy if there isn't a real one. By singling out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the hierarchy create bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsider makes them all insiders. This is why the worst cases of bullying happen with groups. Ask any nerd: you get much worse treatment from a group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some kids bully others, according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If it's any consolation to the nerds, it's nothing personal. The group of kids who band together to pick on you are doing the same thing, and for the same reason, as a bunch of guys who get together to go hunting. They don't actually hate you. They just need something to chase."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who tends to be the primary perpetrators of bullying against nerds in schools?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because they're at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target for the entire school. If I remember correctly, the most popular kids don't persecute nerds; they don't need to stoop to such things. Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous middle classes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the dynamics of popularity and social groups in a cafeteria setting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The trouble is, there are a lot of them. The distribution of popularity is not a pyramid, but tapers at the bottom like a pear. The least popular group is quite small. (I believe we were the only D table in our cafeteria map.) So there are more people who want to pick on nerds than there are nerds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does social dynamics in high school influence friendships and interactions with unpopular peers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids, one loses points by being close to them. A woman I know says that in high school she liked nerds, but was afraid to be seen talking to them because the other girls would make fun of her. Unpopularity is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still ostracize them in self-defense."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do smart students often experience unhappiness during middle and high school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's no wonder, then, that smart kids tend to be unhappy in middle school and high school. Their other interests leave them little attention to spare for popularity, and since popularity resembles a zero-sum game, this in turn makes them targets for the whole school. And the strange thing is, this nightmare scenario happens without any conscious malice, merely because of the shape of the situation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What age range do many people consider the most challenging period of adolescence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For me the worst stretch was junior high, when kid culture was new and harsh, and the specialization that would later gradually separate the smarter kids had barely begun. Nearly everyone I've talked to agrees: the nadir is somewhere between eleven and fourteen."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What incident prompted a teacher to address bullying in eighth grade?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In our school it was eighth grade, which was ages twelve and thirteen for me. There was a brief sensation that year when one of our teachers overheard a group of girls waiting for the school bus, and was so shocked that the next day she devoted the whole class to an eloquent plea not to be so cruel to one another."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the narrator's reaction to someone's surprise regarding a common behavior among people?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It didn't have any noticeable effect. What struck me at the time was that she was surprised. You mean she doesn't know the kind of things they say to one another? You mean this isn't normal?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the general awareness of adults regarding the cruelty that children inflict on each other?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's important to realize that, no, the adults don't know what the kids are doing to one another. They know, in the abstract, that kids are monstrously cruel to one another, just as we know in the abstract that people get tortured in poorer countries. But, like us, they don't like to dwell on this depressing fact, and they don't see evidence of specific abuses unless they go looking for it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the responsibilities of public school teachers compare to those of prison wardens?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison wardens. Wardens' main concern is to keep the prisoners on the premises. They also need to keep them fed, and as far as possible prevent them from killing one another. Beyond that, they want to have as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leave them to create whatever social organization they want. From what I've read, the society that the prisoners create is warped, savage, and pervasive, and it is no fun to be at the bottom of it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the conditions and culture like in the schools described in the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In outline, it was the same at the schools I went to. The most important thing was to stay on the premises. While there, the authorities fed you, prevented overt violence, and made some effort to teach you something. But beyond that they didn't want to have too much to do with the kids. Like prison wardens, the teachers mostly left us to ourselves. And, like prisoners, the culture we created was barbaric."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the perception that adults are more accepting of nerds compared to children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why is the real world more hospitable to nerds? It might seem that the answer is simply that it's populated by adults, who are too mature to pick on one another. But I don't think this is true. Adults in prison certainly pick on one another. And so, apparently, do society wives; in some parts of Manhattan, life for women sounds like a continuation of high school, with all the same petty intrigues."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of environments like schools and prisons compared to the real world in terms of the impact of individual actions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think the important thing about the real world is not that it's populated by adults, but that it's very large, and the things you do have real effects. That's what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch all lack. The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect. Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery. They have no function for their form to follow."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities distinguish successful individuals in fields where practical results matter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When the things you do have real effects, it's no longer enough just to be pleasing. It starts to be important to get the right answers, and that's where nerds show to advantage. Bill Gates will of course come to mind. Though notoriously lacking in social skills, he gets the right answers, at least as measured in revenue."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do social dynamics and environments influence the behavior and self-perception of individuals within intellectual communities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other thing that's different about the real world is that it's much larger. In a large enough pool, even the smallest minorities can achieve a critical mass if they clump together. Out in the real world, nerds collect in certain places and form their own societies where intelligence is the most important thing. Sometimes the current even starts to flow in the other direction: sometimes, particularly in university math and science departments, nerds deliberately exaggerate their awkwardness in order to seem smarter. John Nash so admired Norbert Wiener that he adopted his habit of touching the wall as he walked down a corridor."}]}

I didn't realize that the reason we nerds didn't fit in was that in some ways we were a step ahead.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the author compare their experience to that of an adult returning to middle school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We were a bit like an adult would be if he were thrust back into middle school.

We had no such confidence."}]}

Perhaps. But in at least some cases the reason the nerds don't fit in really is that everyone else is crazy. I remember sitting in the audience at a \"pep rally\" at my high school, watching as the cheerleaders threw an effigy of an opposing player into the audience to be torn to pieces. I felt like an explorer witnessing some bizarre tribal ritual."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the author have about their suburban environment during their teenage years?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I could go back and give my thirteen year old self some advice, the main thing I'd tell him would be to stick his head up and look around. I didn't really grasp it at the time, but the whole world we lived in was as fake as a Twinkie. Not just school, but the entire town. Why do people move to suburbia? To have kids! So no wonder it seemed boring and sterile. The whole place was a giant nursery, an artificial town created explicitly for the purpose of breeding children."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How are suburban environments designed to impact children's experiences and safety?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Where I grew up, it felt as if there was nowhere to go, and nothing to do.

Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. In fact their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in one place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. And I have no problem with this: in a specialized industrial society, it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the author's main concerns about the educational system and its impact on children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What bothers me is not that the kids are kept in prisons, but that (a) they aren't told about it, and (b) the prisons are run mostly by the inmates. Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizing meaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run after an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural thing in the world.

If it's physiological, it should be universal. Are Mongol nomads all nihilists at thirteen? I've read a lot of history, and I have not seen a single reference to this supposedly universal fact before the twentieth century. Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance seem to have been cheerful and eager.

Kids in pre-industrial times started working at about 14 at the latest; kids on farms, where most people lived, began far earlier.

In fact, it's derived from the same root as \"tactile,\" and what it means is to have a deft touch. Tactful is the opposite of clumsy. I don't think I learned this until college."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the limitations of Bayesian filtering that affected its widespread adoption despite its effectiveness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I heard about this work I was a bit surprised.  If people had been onto Bayesian filtering four years ago, why wasn't everyone using it? When I read the papers I found out why.  Pantel and Lin's filter was the more effective of the two, but it only caught 92% of spam, with 1.16% false positives."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of varying performance results in Bayesian spam filters for different users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I tried writing a Bayesian spam filter, it caught 99.5% of spam with less than .03% false positives [4]. It's always alarming when two people trying the same experiment get widely divergent results. It's especially alarming here because those two sets of numbers might yield opposite conclusions. Different users have different requirements, but I think for many people a filtering rate of 92% with 1.16% false positives means that filtering is not an acceptable solution, whereas 99.5% with less than .03% false positives means that it is."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors might explain the discrepancies in the results between this study and Pantel and Lin's findings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So why did we get such different numbers? I haven't tried to reproduce Pantel and Lin's results, but from reading the paper I see five things that probably account for the difference."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the size of the training dataset affect the performance evaluation of a spam filter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One is simply that they trained their filter on very little data: 160 spam and 466 nonspam mails. Filter performance should still be climbing with data sets that small.  So their numbers may not even be an accurate measure of the performance of their algorithm, let alone of Bayesian spam filtering in general."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What crucial lesson did the author learn about data while developing spam filters?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I think the most important difference is probably that they ignored message headers.  To anyone who has worked on spam filters, this will seem a perverse decision. And yet in the very first filters I tried writing, I ignored the headers too.  Why?  Because I wanted to keep the problem neat. I didn't know much about mail headers then, and they seemed to me full of random stuff.  There is a lesson here for filter writers: don't ignore data.  You'd think this lesson would be too obvious to mention, but I've had to learn it several times."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach did Pantel and Lin use to handle variations of words in their analysis, and what concern did it raise?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Third, Pantel and Lin stemmed the tokens, meaning they reduced e.g. both ``mailing'' and ``mailed'' to the root ``mail''.   They may have felt they were forced to do this by the small size of their corpus, but if so this is a kind of premature optimization."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the difference in token usage affect the effectiveness of spam detection algorithms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fourth, they calculated probabilities differently. They used all the tokens, whereas I only use the 15 most significant.  If you use all the tokens you'll tend to miss longer spams, the type where someone tells you their life story up to the point where they got rich from some multilevel marketing scheme.  And such an algorithm would be easy for spammers to spoof: just add a big chunk of random text to counterbalance the spam terms."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What method can be used to adjust the balance between false positives and filtering effectiveness in a spam filtering algorithm?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finally, they didn't bias against false positives. I think any spam filtering algorithm ought to have a convenient knob you can twist to decrease the false positive rate at the expense of the filtering rate. I do this by counting the occurrences of tokens in the nonspam corpus double."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to approach spam filtering differently than standard text classification?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't think it's a good idea to treat spam filtering as a straight text classification problem.  You can use text classification techniques, but solutions can and should reflect the fact that the text is email, and spam in particular.  Email is not just text; it has structure. Spam filtering is not just classification, because false positives are so much worse than false negatives that you should treat them as a different kind of error. And the source of error is not just random variation, but a live human spammer working actively to defeat your filter."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an example of a system that effectively filters spam without being explicitly designed for that purpose?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is the counterexample to the design principle I just mentioned.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the position of a word like \"free\" affect its spam probability in filters?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Such measures increase the filter's vocabulary, which makes it more discriminating.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does increasing the variety of tokens in a corpus affect the accuracy of prediction probabilities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The disadvantage of having a larger universe of tokens is that there is more chance of misses. Spreading your corpus out over more tokens has the same effect as making it smaller. If you consider exclamation points as constituents, for example, then you could end up not having a spam probability for free with seven exclamation points, even though you know that free with just two exclamation points has a probability of 99.99%."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the concept of degeneration in token matching, and how does it affect probability assignment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One solution to this is what I call degeneration.  If you can't find an exact match for a token, treat it as if it were a less specific version.  I consider terminal exclamation points, uppercase letters, and occurring in one of the five marked contexts as making a token more specific. For example, if I don't find a probability for ``Subject*free!'', I look for probabilities for ``Subject*free'', ``free!'', and ``free'', and take whichever one is farthest from .5."}]}

Spams tend to have more sentences in imperative mood, and in those the first word is a verb.  So verbs with initial caps have higher spam probabilities than they would in all lowercase.  In my filter, the spam probability of ``Act'' is 98% and for ``act'' only 62%."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does expanding a filter's vocabulary affect word counting in text analysis?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you increase your filter's vocabulary, you can end up counting the same word multiple times, according to your old definition of ``same''. Logically, they're not the same token anymore.  But if this still bothers you, let me add from experience that the words you seem to be counting multiple times tend to be exactly the ones you'd want to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can a larger vocabulary impact the effectiveness of spam detection in email filtering?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another effect of a larger vocabulary is that when you look at an incoming mail you find more interesting tokens, meaning those with probabilities far from .5.  I use the 15 most interesting to decide if mail is spam. But you can run into a problem when you use a fixed number like this.  If you find a lot of maximally interesting tokens, the result can end up being decided by whatever random factor determines the ordering of equally interesting tokens. One way to deal with this is to treat some as more interesting than others."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can two tokens with vastly different frequencies in spam and legitimate corpora have the same spam probability?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, the token ``dalco'' occurs 3 times in my spam corpus and never in my legitimate corpus.  The token ``Url*optmails'' (meaning ``optmails'' within a url) occurs 1223 times. And yet, as I used to calculate probabilities for tokens, both would have the same spam probability, the threshold of .99."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria should be used to assign probabilities to tokens based on their occurrence in different corpora?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That doesn't feel right.  There are theoretical arguments for giving these two tokens substantially different probabilities (Pantel and Lin do), but I haven't tried that yet. It does seem at least that if we find more than 15 tokens that only occur in one corpus or the other, we ought to give priority to the ones that occur a lot.  So now there are two threshold values.  For tokens that occur only in the spam corpus, the probability is .9999 if they occur more than 10 times and .9998 otherwise.  Ditto at the other end of the scale for tokens found only in the legitimate corpus."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach does Steven Hauser suggest for improving the effectiveness of a statistical spam filter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another possibility would be to consider not just 15 tokens, but all the tokens over a certain threshold of interestingness.  Steven Hauser does this in his statistical spam filter [8]. If you use a threshold, make it very high, or spammers could spoof you by packing messages with more innocent words."}]}

I've tried the whole spectrum of options, from ignoring it to parsing it all.  Ignoring html is a bad idea, because it's full of useful spam signs.  But if you parse it all, your filter might degenerate into a mere html recognizer.  The most effective approach seems to be the middle course, to notice some tokens but not others.  I look at a, img, and font tags, and ignore the rest.  Links and images you should certainly look at, because they contain urls."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might it not be necessary to invest significant time in improving HTML handling for spam filtering?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I could probably be smarter about dealing with html, but I don't think it's worth putting a lot of time into this. Spams full of html are easy to filter.  The smarter spammers already avoid it.  So performance in the future should not depend much on how you deal with html."}]}

They're hard to filter based just on the content because the headers are innocent and they're careful about the words they use.  Even so I can usually catch them.

When I wrote ``A Plan for Spam'' I hadn't had any, and I didn't know what they'd be like.  Now that I've had a few, I'm relieved to find they're not as bad as I feared. False positives yielded by statistical filters turn out to be mails that sound a lot like spam, and these tend to be the ones you would least mind missing [9]."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What led to the classification of certain newsletters as false positives in email filtering?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Two of the false positives were newsletters from companies I've bought things from.  I never asked to receive them, so arguably they were spams, but I count them as false positives because I hadn't been deleting them as spams before.  The reason the filters caught them was that both companies in January switched to commercial email senders instead of sending the mails from their own servers, and both the headers and the bodies became much spammier."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What issue arose from making tokens case sensitive in the Plan for Spam filter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The third false positive was a bad one, though.  It was from someone in Egypt and written in all uppercase.  This was a direct result of making tokens case sensitive; the Plan for Spam filter wouldn't have caught it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do effective filters face in accurately categorizing emails?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's hard to say what the overall false positive rate is, because we're up in the noise, statistically. Anyone who has worked on filters (at least, effective filters) will be aware of this problem. With some emails it's hard to say whether they're spam or not, and these are the ones you end up looking at when you get filters really tight.  For example, so far the filter has caught two emails that were sent to my address because of a typo, and one sent to me in the belief that I was someone else.  Arguably, these are neither my spam nor my nonspam mail."}]}

I wrote to them pretending to be a customer, and since the reply came back through Virtumundo's mail servers it had the most incriminating headers imaginable.  Arguably this isn't a real false positive either, but a sort of Heisenberg uncertainty effect: I only got it because I was writing about spam filtering."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might the reliability of the reported number be questioned?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't think this number can be trusted, partly because the sample is so small, and partly because I think I can fix the filter not to catch some of these."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the distinction between false positives and false negatives in the context of filtering performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False positives seem to me a different kind of error from false negatives. Filtering rate is a measure of performance.  False positives I consider more like bugs.  I approach improving the filtering rate as optimization, and decreasing false positives as debugging."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What issues contributed to the false positives identified in the email filter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So these five false positives are my bug list.

You can filter those based just on the headers, no matter what they say in the body.  But anyone willing to falsify headers or use open relays, presumably including most porn spammers, should be able to get some message past network-level filters if they want to.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What benefit do individual filters provide in combating spam?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But the real advantage of individual filters is that they'll all be different.  If everyone's filters have different probabilities, it will make the spammers' optimization loop, what programmers would call their edit-compile-test cycle, appallingly slow. Instead of just tweaking a spam till it gets through a copy of some filter they have on their desktop, they'll have to do a test mailing for each tweak.  It would be like programming in a language without an interactive toplevel, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to go beyond user feedback when designing products?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And yet, making what works for the user doesn't mean simply making what the user tells you to.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of understanding user needs beyond their stated desires in design?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer to the paradox, I think, is that you have to design for the user, but you have to design what the user needs, not simply what he says he wants. It's much like being a doctor.  You can't just treat a patient's symptoms.  When a patient tells you his symptoms, you have to figure out what's actually wrong with him, and treat that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to define a specific user group when evaluating design quality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If good design must do what the user needs, who is the user?  When I say that design must be for users, I don't mean to imply that good design aims at some kind of lowest common denominator.  You can pick any group of users you want.  If you're designing a tool, for example, you can design it for anyone from beginners to experts, and what's good design for one group might be bad for another.  The point is, you have to pick some group of users.  I don't think you can even talk about good or bad design except with reference to some intended user."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it beneficial for designers to include themselves among the intended users of their designs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're most likely to get good design if the intended users include the designer himself.

I suspect that very few housing projects in the US were designed by architects who expected to live in them.   You can see the same thing in programming languages.  C, Lisp, and Smalltalk were created for their own designers to use.  Cobol, Ada, and Java, were created for other people to use."}]}

It's different in research.  In math you don't choose abstractions because they're easy for humans to understand; you choose whichever make the proof shorter.  I think this is true for the sciences generally. Scientific ideas are not meant to be ergonomic."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do human interests and limitations influence the field of design and the arts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Over in the arts, things are very different.  Design is all about people.  The human body is a strange thing, but when you're designing a chair, that's what you're designing for, and there's no way around it. All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations of humans.   In painting, for example, all other things being equal a painting with people in it will be more interesting than one without.  It is not merely an accident of history that the great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of people. If they hadn't been, painting as a medium wouldn't have the prestige that it does."}]}

Some ideas are easy for people to grasp and some aren't.  For example, we seem to have a very limited capacity for dealing with detail.  It's this fact that makes programing languages a good idea in the first place; if we could handle the detail, we could just program in machine language."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of choosing the right medium when developing ideas versus presenting finished works?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Remember, too, that languages are not primarily a form for finished programs, but something that programs have to be developed in.  Anyone in the arts could tell you that you might want different mediums for the two situations.  Marble, for example, is a nice, durable medium for finished ideas, but a hopelessly inflexible one for developing new ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of a programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A program, like a proof, is a pruned version of a tree that in the past has had false starts branching off all over it.  So the test of a language is not simply how clean the finished program looks in it, but how clean the path to the finished program was. A design choice that gives you elegant finished programs may not give you an elegant design process.  For example, I've written a few macro-defining macros full of nested backquotes that look now like little gems, but writing them took hours of the ugliest trial and error, and frankly, I'm still not entirely sure they're correct."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common misconception about evaluating programming languages based on the appearance of written code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We often act as if the test of a language were how good finished programs look in it. It seems so convincing when you see the same program written in two languages, and one version is much shorter. When you approach the problem from the direction of the arts, you're less likely to depend on this sort of test.  You don't want to end up with a programming language like marble."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the presence of a read-eval-print loop influence the design and usability of a programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, it is a huge win in developing software to have an interactive toplevel, what in Lisp is called a read-eval-print loop.  And when you have one this has real effects on the design of the language.  It would not work well for a language where you have to declare variables before using them, for example.  When you're just typing expressions into the toplevel, you want to be able to set x to some value and then start doing things to x.  You don't want to have to declare the type of x first.  You may dispute either of the premises, but if a language has to have a toplevel to be convenient, and mandatory type declarations are incompatible with a toplevel, then no language that makes type declarations mandatory could be convenient to program in."}]}

You have to calibrate your ideas on actual users constantly, especially in the beginning.  One of the reasons Jane Austen's novels are so good is that she read them out loud to her family.  That's why she never sinks into self-indulgently arty descriptions of landscapes, or pretentious philosophizing.  (The philosophy's there, but it's woven into the story instead of being pasted onto it like a label.) If you open an average \"literary\" novel and imagine reading it out loud to your friends as something you'd written, you'll feel all too keenly what an imposition that kind of thing is upon the reader."}]}

In drawing, for example, the idea was discovered during the Renaissance.  Now almost every drawing teacher will tell you that the right way to get an accurate drawing is not to work your way slowly around the contour of an object, because errors will accumulate and you'll find at the end that the lines don't meet. Instead you should draw a few quick lines in roughly the right place, and then gradually refine this initial sketch."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some traditional methods used to create prototypes in various fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In most fields, prototypes have traditionally been made out of different materials. Typefaces to be cut in metal were initially designed with a brush on paper.  Statues to be cast in bronze were modelled in wax.  Patterns to be embroidered on tapestries were drawn on paper with ink wash.  Buildings to be constructed from stone were tested on a smaller scale in wood."}]}

A prototype doesn't have to be just a model; you can refine it into the finished product. I think you should always do this when you can.  It lets you take advantage of new insights you have along the way.  But perhaps even more important, it's good for morale."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does an artist's engagement and interest in their work affect the quality of their designs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Morale is key in design.  I'm surprised people don't talk more about it.  One of my first drawing teachers told me: if you're bored when you're drawing something, the drawing will look boring. For example, suppose you have to draw a building, and you decide to draw each brick individually.  You can do this if you want, but if you get bored halfway through and start making the bricks mechanically instead of observing each one, the drawing will look worse than if you had merely suggested the bricks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the process of gradually refining a prototype contribute to motivation and engagement in both software development and the arts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good for morale because it keeps you engaged.  In software, my rule is: always have working code.  If you're writing something that you'll be able to test in an hour, then you have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you. The same is true in the arts, and particularly in oil painting. Most painters start with a blurry sketch and gradually refine it. If you work this way, then in principle you never have to end the day with something that actually looks unfinished.  Indeed, there is even a saying among painters: \"A painting is never finished, you just stop working on it.\"  This idea will be familiar to anyone who has worked on software."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the impact of designer enthusiasm on creating products for unsophisticated users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Morale is another reason that it's hard to design something for an unsophisticated user.   It's hard to stay interested in something you don't like yourself.  To make something good, you have to be thinking, \"wow, this is really great,\" not \"what a piece of shit; those fools will love it.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key difference between design and research in terms of collaboration and control?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Notice all this time I've been talking about \"the designer.\" Design usually has to be under the control of a single person to be any good.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes true collaboration from mere contributions in artistic projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There have been famous instances of collaboration in the arts, but most of them seem to have been cases of molecular bonding rather than nuclear fusion.  In an opera it's common for one person to write the libretto and another to write the music.   And during the Renaissance, journeymen from northern Europe were often employed to do the landscapes in the backgrounds of Italian paintings.  But these aren't true collaborations. They're more like examples of Robert Frost's \"good fences make good neighbors.\"  You can stick instances of good design together, but within each individual project, one person has to be in control."}]}

This is an interesting question.  I don't know the answer.  Perhaps, if design and research converge, the best research is also good design, and in fact can't be done by collaborators. A lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked alone. But I don't know enough to say whether there is a pattern here.  It could be simply that many famous scientists worked when collaboration was less common."}]}

Boats have long had spines and ribs like an animal's ribcage. In some cases we may have to wait for better technology: early aircraft designers were mistaken to design aircraft that looked like birds, because they didn't have materials or power sources light enough (the Wrights' engine weighed 152 lbs. and generated only 12 hp.) or control systems sophisticated enough for machines that flew like birds, but I could imagine little unmanned reconnaissance planes flying like birds in fifty years."}]}

Unleashed, it could be a powerful force."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key considerations for designing Web-based applications compared to traditional desktop software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To developers, the most conspicuous difference between Web-based and desktop software is that a Web-based application is not a single piece of code.  It will be a collection of programs of different types rather than a single big binary.  And so designing Web-based software is like desiging a city rather than a building: as well as buildings you need roads, street signs, utilities, police and fire departments, and plans for both growth and various kinds of disasters."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What considerations were taken into account during the server setup process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It did not end with software.  We spent a lot of time thinking about server configurations.  We built the servers ourselves, from components-- partly to save money, and partly to get exactly what we wanted.  We had to think about whether our upstream ISP had fast enough connections to all the backbones.  We serially"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does controlling hardware enhance user experience and provide a competitive advantage in software applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But hardware is not just something to worry about.  When you control it you can do more for users.  With a desktop application, you can specify certain minimum hardware, but you can't add more.  If you administer the servers, you can in one step enable all your users to page people, or send faxes, or send commands by phone, or process credit cards, etc, just by installing the relevant hardware.  We always looked for new ways to add features with hardware, not just because it pleased users, but also as a way to distinguish ourselves from competitors who (either because they sold desktop software, or resold Web-based applications through ISPs) didn't have direct control over the hardware."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of using multiple programming languages in web-based applications compared to desktop software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because the software in a Web-based application will be a collection of programs rather than a single binary, it can be written in any number of different languages.  When you're writing desktop software, you're practically forced to write the application in the same language as the underlying operating system-- meaning C and C++. And so these languages (especially among nontechnical people like managers and VCs) got to be considered as the languages for \"serious\" software development.  But that was just an artifact of the way desktop software had to be delivered.  For server-based software you can use any language you want. [3 Today a lot of the top hackers are using languages far removed from C and C++:  Perl, Python, and even Lisp."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantages do you have when using server-based software regarding programming language choices?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With server-based software, no one can tell you what language to use, because you control the whole system, right down to the hardware.  Different languages are good for different tasks.  You can use whichever is best for each.  And when you have competitors, \"you can\" means \"you must\" (we'll return to this later), because if you don't take advantage of this possibility, your competitors will."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What programming languages did most competitors use, and what limitations did this impose on their software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most of our competitors used C and C++, and this made their software visibly inferior because (among other things), they had no way around the statelessness of CGI scripts.  If you were going to change something, all the changes had to happen on one page, with an Update button at the bottom.  As I've written elsewhere, by using"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the process of software releases changed in the new digital landscape compared to traditional desktop software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most important changes in this new world is the way you do releases. In the desktop software business, doing a release is a huge trauma, in which the whole company sweats and strains to push out a single, giant piece of code.  Obvious comparisons suggest themselves, both to the process and the resulting product."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the release frequency of server-based software compare to that of typical desktop software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With server-based software, you can make changes almost as you would in a program you were writing for yourself.  You release software as a series of incremental changes instead of an occasional big explosion. A typical desktop software company might do one or two releases a year.  At Viaweb we often did three to five releases a day."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the release process impact software development issues in the desktop software industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you switch to this new model, you realize how much software development is affected by the way it is released.  Many of the nastiest problems you see in the desktop software business are due to catastrophic nature of releases."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do software developers face when releasing only one version per year?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you release only one new version a year, you tend to deal with bugs wholesale.  Some time before the release date you assemble a new version in which half the code has been torn out and replaced, introducing countless bugs.  Then a squad of QA people step in and start counting them, and the programmers work down the list, fixing them.  They do not generally get to the end of the list, and indeed, no one is sure where the end is.  It's like fishing rubble out of a pond.  You never really know what's happening inside the software. At best you end up with a statistical sort of correctness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of using server-based software in terms of code changes and testing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With server-based software, most of the change is small and incremental.  That in itself is less likely to introduce bugs.  It also means you know what to test most carefully when you're about to release software: the last thing you changed.  You end up with a much firmer grip on the code.  As a general rule, you do know what's happening inside it.  You don't have the source code memorized, of course, but when you read the source you do it like a pilot scanning the instrument panel, not like a detective trying to unravel some mystery."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What attitude do developers often adopt towards bugs in desktop software, and how does it affect their approach to feature releases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Desktop software breeds a certain fatalism about bugs.  You know that you're shipping something loaded with bugs, and you've even set up mechanisms to compensate for it (e.g. patch releases).  So why worry about a few more?  Soon you're releasing whole features you know are broken."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did the company choose to release their new operating system despite some features not being ready?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "did this earlier this year.  They felt under pressure to release their new OS, whose release date had already slipped four times, but some of the software (support for CDs and DVDs) wasn't ready. The solution?  They released the OS without the unfinished parts, and users will have to install them later."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the concept of software versions differ between traditional software and Web-based software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The industry veteran may be thinking, it's a fine-sounding idea to say that you never have to release software before it works, but what happens when you've promised to deliver a new version of your software by a certain date?  With Web-based software, you wouldn't make such a promise, because there are no versions.  Your software changes gradually and continuously.  Some changes might be bigger than others, but the idea of versions just doesn't naturally fit onto Web-based software."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did Viaweb frequently announce new versions of their software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If anyone remembers Viaweb this might sound odd, because we were always announcing new versions.  This was done entirely for PR purposes.  The trade press, we learned, thinks in version numbers. They will give you major coverage for a major release, meaning a new first digit on the version number, and generally a paragraph at most for a point release, meaning a new digit after the decimal point."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did the company decide to start assigning version numbers to their software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some of our competitors were offering desktop software and actually had version numbers.  And for these releases, the mere fact of which seemed to us evidence of their backwardness, they would get all kinds of publicity.  We didn't want to miss out, so we started giving version numbers to our software too.  When we wanted some publicity, we'd make a list of all the features we'd added since the last \"release,\" stick a new version number on the software, and issue a press release saying that the new version was available immediately.  Amazingly, no one ever called us on it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the acquisition of Viaweb by Yahoo impact the software versioning and publicity strategy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By the time we were bought, we had done this three times, so we were on Version 4.  Version 4.1 if I remember correctly.  After Viaweb became Yahoo Store, there was no longer such a desperate need for publicity, so although the software continued to evolve, the whole idea of version numbers was quietly dropped."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key benefit of Web-based software in terms of debugging compared to desktop software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other major technical advantage of Web-based software is that you can reproduce most bugs.  You have the users' data right there on your disk.  If someone breaks your software, you don't have to try to guess what's going on, as you would with desktop software: you should be able to reproduce the error while they're on the phone with you.  You might even know about it already, if you have code for noticing errors built into your application."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of releasing Web-based software gradually in terms of debugging?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Software companies are sometimes accused of letting the users debug their software.  And that is just what I'm advocating.  For Web-based software it's actually a good plan, because the bugs are fewer and transient.  When you release software gradually you get far fewer bugs to start with.  And when you can reproduce errors and release changes instantly, you can find and fix most bugs as soon as they appear.  We never had enough bugs at any one time to bother with a formal bug-tracking system."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What practices can help minimize the impact of software bugs on users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You should test changes before you release them, of course, so no major bugs should get released.  Those few that inevitably slip through will involve borderline cases and will only affect the few users that encounter them before someone calls in to complain.  As long as you fix bugs right away, the net effect, for the average user, is far fewer bugs.  I doubt the average Viaweb user ever saw a bug."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it generally easier to fix bugs in recently written code compared to older code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fixing fresh bugs is easier than fixing old ones.  It's usually fairly quick to find a bug in code you just wrote.  When it turns up you often know what's wrong before you even look at the source, because you were already worrying about it subconsciously. Fixing a bug in something you wrote six months ago (the average case if you release once a year) is a lot more work.  And since you don't understand the code as well, you're more likely to fix it in an ugly way, or even introduce more bugs. [4]"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of catching bugs early in software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you catch bugs early, you also get fewer compound bugs. Compound bugs are two separate bugs that interact:  you trip going downstairs, and when you reach for the handrail it comes off in your hand.  In software this kind of bug is the hardest to find, and also tends to have the worst consequences. [5 The traditional \"break everything and then filter out the bugs\" approach inherently yields a lot of compound bugs.  And software that's released in a series of small changes inherently tends not to. The floors are constantly being swept clean of any loose objects that might later get stuck in something."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of using functional programming in web-based applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It helps if you use a technique called functional programming. Functional programming means avoiding side-effects.  It's something you're more likely to see in research papers than commercial software, but for Web-based applications it turns out to be really useful.  It's hard to write entire programs as purely functional code, but you can write substantial chunks this way.  It makes those parts of your software easier to test, because they have no state, and that is very convenient in a situation where you are constantly making and testing small modifications.  I wrote much of Viaweb's editor in this style, and we made our scripting language,"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did advanced users at Viaweb perceive and respond to software bugs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People from the desktop software business will find this hard to credit, but at Viaweb bugs became almost a game.  Since most released bugs involved borderline cases, the users who encountered them were likely to be advanced users, pushing the envelope.  Advanced users are more forgiving about bugs, especially since you probably introduced them in the course of adding some feature they were asking for.  In fact, because bugs were rare and you had to be doing sophisticated things to see them, advanced users were often proud to catch one.  They would call support in a spirit more of triumph than anger, as if they had scored points off us."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the ability to reproduce errors impact the approach to customer support in software companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you can reproduce errors, it changes your approach to customer support.  At most software companies, support is offered as a way to make customers feel better.  They're either calling you about a known bug, or they're just doing something wrong and you have to figure out what.  In either case there's not much you can learn from them.  And so you tend to view support calls as a pain in the ass that you want to isolate from your developers as much as possible."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Viaweb approach customer support and feedback?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This was not how things worked at Viaweb.  At Viaweb, support was free, because we wanted to hear from customers.  If someone had a problem, we wanted to know about it right away so that we could reproduce the error and release a fix."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the proximity of developers to customer support at Viaweb impact their ability to address bugs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So at Viaweb the developers were always in close contact with support.  The customer support people were about thirty feet away from the programmers, and knew that they could always interrupt anything with a report of a genuine bug.  We would leave a board meeting to fix a serious bug."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the new customer support approach benefit customers, support staff, and programmers alike?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Our approach to support made everyone happier.  The customers were delighted.  Just imagine how it would feel to call a support line and be treated as someone bringing important news.  The customer support people liked it because it meant they could help the users, instead of reading scripts to them.  And the programmers liked it because they could reproduce bugs instead of just hearing vague second-hand reports about them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role did customer support play in the development and marketing of products after the acquisition by Yahoo?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "After we were bought by Yahoo, the customer support people were moved far away from the programmers.  It was only then that we realized that they were effectively QA and to some extent marketing as well.  In addition to catching bugs, they were the keepers of the knowledge of vaguer, buglike things, like features that confused users. [6 They were also a kind of proxy focus group; we could ask them which of two new features users wanted more, and they were always right."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of having the ability to release software immediately?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Being able to release software immediately is a big motivator. Often as I was walking to work I would think of some change I wanted to make to the software, and do it that day.  This worked for bigger features as well.  Even if something was going to take two weeks to write (few projects took longer), I knew I could see the effect in the software as soon as it was done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the process of implementing one idea influence the generation of new ideas in creative projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I'd had to wait a year for the next release, I would have shelved most of these ideas, for a while at least.  The thing about ideas, though, is that they lead to more ideas.  Have you ever noticed that when you sit down to write something, half the ideas that end up in it are ones you thought of while writing it?  The same thing happens with software.  Working to implement one idea gives you more ideas.  So shelving an idea costs you not only that delay in implementing it, but also all the ideas that implementing it would have led to.  In fact, shelving an idea probably even inhibits new ideas: as you start to think of some new feature, you catch sight of the shelf and think \"but I already have a lot of new things I want to do for the next release.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between planning and implementation in the context of innovation at Viaweb?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What big companies do instead of implementing features is plan them.  At Viaweb we sometimes ran into trouble on this account. Investors and analysts would ask us what we had planned for the future.  The truthful answer would have been, we didn't have any plans.  We had general ideas about things we wanted to improve, but if we knew how we would have done it already.  What were we going to do in the next six months? Whatever looked like the biggest win.  I don't know if I ever dared give this answer, but that was the truth.  Plans are just another word for ideas on the shelf. When we thought of good ideas, we implemented them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to software release reliability in a company with individual code ownership?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At Viaweb, as at many software companies, most code had one definite owner.  But when you owned something you really owned it: no one except the owner of a piece of software had to approve (or even know about) a release.  There was no protection against breakage except the fear of looking like an idiot to one's peers, and that was more than enough.  I may have given the impression that we just blithely plowed forward writing code.  We did go fast, but we thought very carefully before we released software onto those servers.  And paying attention is more important to reliability than moving slowly.  Because he pays close attention, a Navy pilot can land a 40,000 lb. aircraft at 140 miles per hour on a pitching carrier deck, at night, more safely than the average teenager can cut a bagel."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of agile software development in small versus large teams?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This way of writing software is a double-edged sword of course. It works a lot better for a small team of good, trusted programmers than it would for a big company of mediocre ones, where bad ideas are caught by committees instead of the people that had them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the team size for Web-based software development compare to that of traditional desktop software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fortunately, Web-based software does require fewer programmers. I once worked for a medium-sized desktop software company that had over 100 people working in engineering as a whole.  Only 13 of these were in product development.  All the rest were working on releases, ports, and so on.  With Web-based software, all you need (at most) are the 13 people, because there are no releases, ports, and so on."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy did the founders of Viaweb use to address concerns about their small team size while seeking to attract buyers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Viaweb was written by just three people. [7 I was always under pressure to hire more, because we wanted to get bought, and we knew that buyers would have a hard time paying a high price for a company with only three programmers.  (Solution:  we hired more, but created new projects for them.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the size of a development team impact the efficiency of software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "adding people to a project tends to slow it down.  The number of possible connections between developers grows exponentially with the size of the group.  The larger the group, the more time they'll spend in meetings negotiating how their software will work together, and the more bugs they'll get from unforeseen interactions. Fortunately, this process also works in reverse: as groups get smaller, software development gets exponentially more efficient. I can't remember the programmers at Viaweb ever having an actual meeting.  We never had more to say at any one time than we could say as we were walking to lunch."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do programmers face when they also have to manage system administration duties?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If there is a downside here, it is that all the programmers have to be to some degree system administrators as well.  When you're hosting software, someone has to be watching the servers, and in practice the only people who can do this properly are the ones who wrote the software.  At Viaweb our system had so many components and changed so frequently that there was no definite border between software and infrastructure.  Arbitrarily declaring such a border would have constrained our design choices.  And so although we were constantly hoping that one day (\"in a couple months\") everything would be stable enough that we could hire someone whose job was just to worry about the servers, it never happened."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the ongoing responsibilities of developers for web-based software after its initial launch?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't think it could be any other way, as long as you're still actively developing the product.  Web-based software is never going to be something you write, check in, and go home.  It's a live thing, running on your servers right now.  A bad bug might not just crash one user's process; it could crash them all.  If a bug in your code corrupts some data on disk, you have to fix it.  And so on.  We found that you don't have to watch the servers every minute (after the first year or so), but you definitely want to keep an eye on things you've changed recently.  You don't release code late at night and then go home."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does server-based software enhance the relationship between developers and users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With server-based software, you're in closer touch with your code. You can also be in closer touch with your users.  Intuit is famous for introducing themselves to customers at retail stores and asking to follow them home.  If you've ever watched someone use your software for the first time, you know what surprises must have awaited them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can server-based software enhance our understanding of user behavior compared to traditional methods?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Software should do what users think it will.  But you can't have any idea what users will be thinking, believe me, until you watch them.  And server-based software gives you unprecedented information about their behavior.  You're not limited to small, artificial focus groups.  You can see every click made by every user.  You have to consider carefully what you're going to look at, because you don't want to violate users' privacy, but even the most general statistical sampling can be very useful."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can monitoring actual users on a server improve optimization decisions compared to relying on benchmarks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you have the users on your server, you don't have to rely on benchmarks, for example.  Benchmarks are simulated users.  With server-based software, you can watch actual users.  To decide what to optimize, just log into a server and see what's consuming all the CPU.  And you know when to stop optimizing too: we eventually got the Viaweb editor to the point where it was memory-bound rather than CPU-bound, and since there was nothing we could do to decrease the size of users' data (well, nothing easy), we knew we might as well stop there."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does software efficiency impact the profitability of server-based applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Efficiency matters for server-based software, because you're paying for the hardware.  The number of users you can support per server is the divisor of your capital cost, so if you can make your software very efficient you can undersell competitors and still make a profit.  At Viaweb we got the capital cost per user down to about $5.  It would be less now, probably less than the cost of sending them the first month's bill.  Hardware is free now, if your software is reasonably efficient."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did user feedback influence the design and functionality of Viaweb's RTML scripting language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Watching users can guide you in design as well as optimization. Viaweb had a scripting language called RTML that let advanced users define their own page styles.  We found that RTML became a kind of suggestion box, because users only used it when the predefined page styles couldn't do what they wanted.  Originally the editor put button bars across the page, for example, but after a number of users used RTML to put buttons down the left"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Viaweb enhance user experience and engagement during their online test drive?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finally, by watching users you can often tell when they're in trouble.  And since the customer is always right, that's a sign of something you need to fix.  At Viaweb the key to getting users was the online test drive.  It was not just a series of slides built by marketing people.  In our test drive, users actually used the software.  It took about five minutes, and at the end of it they had built a real, working store."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can improving the test drive experience impact user acquisition for Web-based applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The test drive was the way we got nearly all our new users.  I think it will be the same for most Web-based applications.   If users can get through a test drive successfully, they'll like the product.  If they get confused or bored, they won't.  So anything we could do to get more people through the test drive would increase our growth rate."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did addressing user confusion during a test drive impact completion rates and revenue growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I studied click trails of people taking the test drive and found that at a certain step they would get confused and click on the browser's Back button.  (If you try writing Web-based applications, you'll find that the Back button becomes one of your most interesting philosophical problems.) So I added a message at that point, telling users that they were nearly finished, and reminding them not to click on the Back button.  Another great thing about Web-based software is that you get instant feedback from changes:  the number of people completing the test drive rose immediately from 60% to 90%.  And since the number of new users was a function of the number of completed test drives, our revenue growth increased by 50%, just from that change."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of software monetization evolved in relation to subscription models?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the early 1990s I read an article in which someone said that software was a subscription business.  At first this seemed a very cynical statement.  But later I realized that it reflects reality: software development is an ongoing process.  I think it's cleaner if you openly charge subscription fees, instead of forcing people to keep buying and installing new versions so that they'll keep paying you.  And fortunately, subscriptions are the natural way to bill for Web-based applications."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are companies likely to be the primary providers of hosting applications instead of freeware?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hosting applications is an area where companies will play a role that is not likely to be filled by freeware.  Hosting applications is a lot of stress, and has real expenses.  No one is going to want to do it for free."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of Web-based applications for companies in terms of revenue and customer management?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For companies, Web-based applications are an ideal source of revenue. Instead of starting each quarter with a blank slate, you have a recurring revenue stream.  Because your software evolves gradually, you don't have to worry that a new model will flop; there never need be a new model, per se, and if you do something to the software that users hate, you'll know right away.  You have no trouble with uncollectable bills; if someone won't pay you can just turn off the service.  And there is no possibility of piracy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can software piracy potentially benefit companies in terms of user base and market standardization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That last \"advantage\" may turn out to be a problem.  Some amount of piracy is to the advantage of software companies.  If some user really would not have bought your software at any price, you haven't lost anything if he uses a pirated copy.  In fact you gain, because he is one more user helping to make your software the standard-- or who might buy a copy later, when he graduates from high school."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do companies utilize price discrimination in relation to software pricing and piracy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When they can, companies like to do something called price discrimination, which means charging each customer as much as they can afford. [8Software is particularly suitable for price discrimination, because the marginal cost is close to zero.  This is why some software costs more to run on Suns than on Intel boxes: a company that uses Suns is not interested in saving money and can safely be charged more.  Piracy is effectively the lowest tier of price discrimination.  I think that software companies understand this and deliberately turn a blind eye to some kinds of piracy.

You might think that people decide to buy something, and then buy it, as two separate steps. That's what I thought before Viaweb, to the extent I thought about the question at all.  In fact the second step can propagate back into the first: if something is hard to buy, people will change their mind about whether they wanted it.  And vice versa: you'll sell more of something when it's easy to buy.  I buy more books because Amazon exists.  Web-based software is just about the easiest thing in the world to buy, especially if you have just done an online demo.  Users should not have to do much more than enter a credit card number.  (Make them do more at your peril.)"}]}

This is a bad idea.  You have to be administering the servers, because you need to be constantly improving both hardware and software.  If you give up direct control of the servers, you give up most of the advantages of developing Web-based applications."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do companies face when attempting to sell Web-based software through ISPs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Several of our competitors shot themselves in the foot this way-- usually, I think, because they were overrun by suits who were excited about this huge potential channel, and didn't realize that it would ruin the product they hoped to sell through it.  Selling Web-based software through ISPs is like selling sushi through vending machines."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who are the primary users of Web-based applications according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Who will the customers be?  At Viaweb they were initially individuals and smaller companies, and I think this will be the rule with Web-based applications.  These are the users who are ready to try new things, partly because they're more flexible, and partly because they want the lower costs of new technology."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of using web-based applications for large companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Web-based applications will often be the best thing for big companies too (though they'll be slow to realize it).  The best intranet is the Internet.  If a company uses true Web-based applications, the software will work better, the servers will be better administered, and employees will have access to the system from anywhere."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is effective server management crucial for the success of a business?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you want to keep your money safe, do you keep it under your mattress at home, or put it in a bank? This argument applies to every aspect of server administration:  not just security, but uptime, bandwidth, load management, backups, etc.  Our existence depended on doing these things right.  Server problems were the big no-no for us, like a dangerous toy would be for a toy maker, or a salmonella outbreak for a food processor."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential benefits of outsourcing IT services for companies that rely on Web-based applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A big company that uses Web-based applications is to that extent outsourcing IT.  Drastic as it sounds, I think this is generally a good idea.  Companies are likely to get better service this way than they would from in-house system administrators.  System administrators can become cranky and unresponsive because they're not directly exposed to competitive pressure:  a salesman has to deal with customers, and a developer has to deal with competitors' software, but a system administrator, like an old bachelor, has few external forces to keep him in line. [10 At Viaweb we had external forces in plenty to keep us in line. The people calling us were customers, not just co-workers.  If a server got wedged, we jumped; just thinking about it gives me a jolt of adrenaline, years later."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might large companies be slow to adopt Web-based applications despite their advantages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So Web-based applications will ordinarily be the right answer for big companies too.  They will be the last to realize it, however, just as they were with desktop computers.  And partly for the same reason: it will be worth a lot of money to convince big companies that they need something more expensive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do big companies often pay significantly more for products, and how does this relate to the viability of intranet software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A large part of what big companies pay extra for is the cost of selling expensive things to them.  (If the Defense Department pays a thousand dollars for toilet seats, it's partly because it costs a lot to sell toilet seats for a thousand dollars.)  And this is one reason intranet software will continue to thrive, even though it is probably a bad idea.  It's simply more expensive.  There is nothing you can do about this conundrum, so the best plan is to go for the smaller customers first.  The rest will come in time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What led to the decline of server-based software in favor of desktop computers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Running software on the server is nothing new.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the affordability of technology influenced the development and distribution of server-based software by startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It looks as if server-based software will be good this time around, because startups will write it.  Computers are so cheap now that you can get started, as we did, using a desktop computer as a server.  Inexpensive processors have eaten the workstation market (you rarely even hear the word now) and are most of the way through the server market; Yahoo's servers, which deal with loads as high as any on the Internet, all have the same inexpensive Intel processors that you have in your desktop machine.  And once you've written the software, all you need to sell it is a Web site.  Nearly all our users came direct to our site through word of mouth and references in the press. [12]"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What initial challenges did the founders of Viaweb face when starting their company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Viaweb was a typical larval startup.  We were terrified of starting a company, and for the first few months comforted ourselves by treating the whole thing as an experiment that we might call off at any moment.  Fortunately, there were few obstacles except technical ones.  While we were writing the software, our Web server was the same desktop machine we used for development, connected to the outside world by a dialup line.  Our only expenses in that phase were food and rent."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are startups increasingly choosing to develop Web-based software instead of desktop software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is all the more reason for startups to write Web-based software now, because writing desktop software has become a lot less fun. If you want to write desktop software now you do it on Microsoft's terms, calling their APIs and working around their buggy OS.  And if you manage to write something that takes off, you may find that you were merely doing market research for Microsoft."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to a company's success in creating a platform that attracts developers and startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If a company wants to make a platform that startups will build on, they have to make it something that hackers themselves will want to use.   That means it has to be inexpensive and well-designed. The Mac was popular with hackers when it first came out, and a lot of them wrote software for it. [13You see this less with Windows, because hackers don't use it.  The kind of people who are good at writing software tend to be running Linux or FreeBSD now."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantages did the web provide for software development compared to traditional desktop software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't think we would have started a startup to write desktop software, because desktop software has to run on Windows, and before we could write software for Windows we'd have to use it.  The Web let us do an end-run around Windows, and deliver software running on Unix direct to users through the browser.  That is a liberating prospect, a lot like the arrival of PCs twenty-five years ago."}]}

After all, Microsoft deliberately built their business in IBM's blind spot."}]}

Most users probably don't.  That's a problem for Microsoft, and they know it.  If applications run on remote servers, no one needs Windows.  What will Microsoft do?  Will they be able to use their control of the desktop to prevent, or constrain, this new generation of software?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What future developments in Microsoft's operating system strategy are anticipated regarding server and desktop integration?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My guess is that Microsoft will develop some kind of server/desktop hybrid, where the operating system works together with servers they control.  At a minimum, files will be centrally available for users who want that.  I don't expect Microsoft to go all the way to the extreme of doing the computations on the server, with only a browser for a client, if they can avoid it. If you only need a browser for a client, you don't need Microsoft on the client, and if Microsoft doesn't control the client, they can't push users towards their server-based applications."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges might Microsoft face in maintaining control over its applications across different client types?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think Microsoft will have a hard time keeping the genie in the bottle.  There will be too many different types of clients for them to control them all.  And if Microsoft's applications only work with some clients, competitors will be able to trump them by offering applications that work from any client. [14]"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might Microsoft’s role change in the landscape of Web-based applications compared to their dominance in desktop applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In a world of Web-based applications, there is no automatic place for Microsoft.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges might established companies face when transitioning to new technologies while trying to protect their existing profitable products?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not so much that a competitor will trip them up as that they will trip over themselves.  With the rise of Web-based software, they will be facing not just technical problems but their own wishful thinking.  What they need to do is cannibalize their existing business, and I can't see them facing that.  The same single-mindedness that has brought them this far will now be working against them. IBM was in exactly the same situation, and they could not master it.  IBM made a late and half-hearted entry into the microcomputer business because they were ambivalent about threatening their cash cow, mainframe computing.  Microsoft will likewise be hampered by wanting to save the desktop.  A cash cow can be a damned heavy monkey on your back."}]}

Lots of small companies flourished, and did it by making cool things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key characteristics of a classic startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The classic startup is fast and informal, with few people and little money.

You can write and launch a product with even fewer people and even less money.  You have to be even faster, and you can get away with being more informal. You can literally launch your product as three guys sitting in the living room of an apartment, and a server collocated at an ISP. We did."}]}

In 1960, software development meant a roomful of men with horn rimmed glasses and narrow black neckties, industriously writing ten lines of code a day on IBM coding forms.  In 1980, it was a team of eight to ten people wearing jeans to the office and typing into vt100s.  Now it's a couple of guys sitting in a living room with laptops.  (And jeans turn out not to be the last word in informality.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the challenges and pressures faced by startups developing Web-based applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups are stressful, and this, unfortunately, is also taken to an extreme with Web-based applications. Many software companies, especially at the beginning, have periods where the developers slept under their desks and so on.  The alarming thing about Web-based software is that there is nothing to prevent this becoming the default.  The stories about sleeping under desks usually end:  then at last we shipped it and we all went home and slept for a week.  Web-based software never ships.  You can work 16-hour days for as long as you want to.  And because you can, and your competitors can, you tend to be forced to.  You can, so you must.  It's Parkinson's Law running in reverse."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do Web-based applications blur the responsibilities and stresses of programmers and system administrators?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The worst thing is not the hours but the responsibility.  Programmers and system administrators traditionally each have their own separate worries.  Programmers have to worry about bugs, and system administrators have to worry about infrastructure.  Programmers may spend a long day up to their elbows in source code, but at some point they get to go home and forget about it.  System administrators never quite leave the job behind, but when they do get paged at 4:00 AM, they don't usually have to do anything very complicated. With Web-based applications, these two kinds of stress get combined. The programmers become system administrators, but without the sharply defined limits that ordinarily make the job bearable."}]}

In a desktop software company, this would have been the part where we were working hard, but it felt like a vacation compared to the next phase, when we took users onto our server.  The second biggest benefit of selling Viaweb to Yahoo (after the money) was to be able to dump ultimate responsibility for the whole thing onto the shoulders of a big company."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the shift from desktop to web-based software impact the roles of users and programmers in startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Desktop software forces users to become system administrators. Web-based software forces programmers to.  There is less stress in total, but more for the programmers.  That's not necessarily bad news.

And for a significant number of users, software that you can use from any browser will be enough of a win in itself to outweigh any awkwardness in the UI.  Maybe you can't write the best-looking spreadsheet using HTML, but you can write a spreadsheet that several people can use simultaneously from different locations without special client software, or that can incorporate live data feeds, or that can page you when certain conditions are triggered. More importantly, you can write new kinds of applications that don't even have names yet.  VisiCalc was not merely a microcomputer version of a mainframe application, after all-- it was a new type of application."}]}

You could have some other kind of client.  But I'm pretty sure that's a bad idea.  It would be very convenient if you could assume that everyone would install your client-- so convenient that you could easily convince yourself that they all would-- but if they don't, you're hosed.  Because Web-based software assumes nothing about the client, it will work anywhere the Web works.  That's a big advantage already, and the advantage will grow as new Web devices proliferate.

Convergence is probably coming, but where?  I can't pick a winner. One thing I can predict is conflict between AOL and Microsoft. Whatever Microsoft's .NET turns out to be, it will probably involve connecting the desktop to servers.  Unless AOL fights back, they will either be pushed aside or turned into a pipe between Microsoft client and server software.  If Microsoft and AOL get into a client war, the only thing sure to work on both will be browsing the Web, meaning Web-based applications will be the only kind that work everywhere."}]}

Fortunately, it can be very cheap to launch a Web-based application.  We launched on under $10,000, and it would be even cheaper today.  We had to spend thousands on a server, and thousands more to get SSL.  (The only company selling SSL software at the time was Netscape.)

It's a lot easier for a couple of hackers to figure out how to rent office space or hire sales people than it is for a company of any size to get software written.

And popularity further separates good languages from bad ones, because feedback from real live users always leads to improvements. Look at how much any popular language has changed during its life.

Maybe for the first couple hours. But a hacker can learn quickly enough that car means the first element of a list and cdr means the rest. Using first and rest means 50% more typing. And they are also different lengths, meaning that the arguments won't line up when they're called, as car and cdr often are, in successive lines. I've found that it matters a lot how code lines up on the page. I can barely read Lisp code when it is set in a variable-width font, and friends say this is true for other languages too."}]}

Perl and Common Lisp occupy opposite poles on this question. Perl programs can be almost cryptically dense, while the names of built-in Common Lisp operators are comically long. The designers of Common Lisp probably expected users to have text editors that would type these long names for them. But the cost of a long name is not just the cost of typing it. There is also the cost of reading it, and the cost of the space it takes up on your screen."}]}

In the history of programming languages a surprising amount of effort has gone into preventing programmers from doing things considered to be improper. This is a dangerously presumptuous plan. How can the language designer know what the programmer is going to need to do? I think language designers would do better to consider their target user to be a genius who will need to do things they never anticipated, rather than a bumbler who needs to be protected from himself. The bumbler will shoot himself in the foot anyway.

Hackers share the surgeon's secret pleasure in poking about in gross innards, the teenager's secret pleasure in popping zits. [2For boys, at least, certain kinds of horrors are fascinating.

They try to protect you from understanding what they're doing. I have never heard hygienic macros explained in one sentence. And they are a classic example of the dangers of deciding what programmers are allowed to want. Hygienic macros are intended to protect me from variable capture, among other things, but variable capture is exactly what I want in some macros."}]}

It's terrifying to build something big from scratch. When people take on a project that's too big, they become overwhelmed. The project either gets bogged down, or the result is sterile and wooden: a shopping mall rather than a real downtown, Brasilia rather than Rome, Ada rather than C."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of starting with throwaway programs in the development of large software systems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another way to get a big program is to start with a throwaway program and keep improving it. This approach is less daunting, and the design of the program benefits from evolution. I think, if one looked, that this would turn out to be the way most big programs were developed. And those that did evolve this way are probably still written in whatever language they were first written in, because it's rare for a program to be ported, except for political reasons. And so, paradoxically, if you want to make a language that is used for big systems, you have to make it good for writing throwaway programs, because that's where big systems come from."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Perl evolve from a collection of utilities into a popular programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perl is a striking example of this idea. It was not only designed for writing throwaway programs, but was pretty much a throwaway program itself. Perl began life as a collection of utilities for generating reports, and only evolved into a programming language as the throwaway programs people wrote in it grew larger. It was not until Perl 5 (if then) that the language was suitable for writing serious programs, and yet it was already massively popular."}]}

To start with, it must be readily available. A throwaway program is something that you expect to write in an hour. So the language probably must already be installed on the computer you're using.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are library functions considered important in programming, particularly in languages like Perl?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you, and merely to call it. And this brings us to what I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming languages: library functions. Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings. This class of library functions are especially important for throwaway programs, which are often originally written for converting or extracting data.  Many Perl programs probably begin as just a couple library calls stuck together."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role will library functions play in the future of programming language design?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think a lot of the advances that happen in programming languages in the next fifty years will have to do with library functions. I think future programming languages will have libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language. Programming language design will not be about whether to make your language strongly or weakly typed, or object oriented, or functional, or whatever, but about how to design great libraries. The kind of language designers who like to think about how to design type systems may shudder at this. It's almost like writing applications! Too bad.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key considerations in designing effective programming libraries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's hard to design good libraries. It's not simply a matter of writing a lot of code. Once the libraries get too big, it can sometimes take longer to find the function you need than to write the code yourself. Libraries need to be designed using a small set of orthogonal operators, just like the core language. It ought to be possible for the programmer to guess what library call will do what he needs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of Common Lisp regarding libraries and operating system interaction?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Libraries are one place Common Lisp falls short. There are only rudimentary libraries for manipulating strings, and almost none for talking to the operating system. For historical reasons, Common Lisp tries to pretend that the OS doesn't exist. And because you can't talk to the OS, you're unlikely to be able to write a serious program using only the built-in operators in Common Lisp. You have to use some implementation-specific hacks as well, and in practice these tend not to give you everything you want.

The conventional wisdom in the Lisp world is that the first problem is the real one. I'm not so sure. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary programmers panic. But I don't think ordinary programmers' opinions matter. Languages become popular or unpopular based on what expert hackers think of them, and I think expert hackers might be able to deal with prefix notation. Perl syntax can be pretty incomprehensible, but that has not stood in the way of Perl's popularity. If anything it may have helped foster a Perl cult."}]}

There is already a good deal of syntax in Lisp. It's not necessarily bad to introduce more, as long as no one is forced to use it. In Common Lisp, some delimiters are reserved for the language, suggesting that at least some of the designers intended to have more syntax in the future."}]}

But in practice I don't think fast code comes primarily from things you do in the design of the language. As Knuth pointed out long ago, speed only matters in certain critical bottlenecks.  And as many programmers have observed since, one is very often mistaken about where these bottlenecks are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the most effective approach to optimizing code performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, in practice, the way to get fast code is to have a very good profiler, rather than by, say, making the language strongly typed. You don't need to know the type of every argument in every call in the program. You do need to be able to declare the types of arguments in the bottlenecks. And even more, you need to be able to find out where the bottlenecks are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common criticism of Lisp regarding performance, and how can it be addressed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it's hard to tell what's expensive. This might be true. It might also be inevitable, if you want to have a very abstract language. And in any case I think good profiling would go a long way toward fixing the problem: you'd soon learn what was expensive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between compiler speed and the effectiveness of profiling tools in programming languages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Part of the problem here is social. Language designers like to write fast compilers. That's how they measure their skill. They think of the profiler as an add-on, at best. But in practice a good profiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written in the language than a compiler that generates fast code. Here, again, language designers are somewhat out of touch with their users. They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrong problem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can an active profiler improve a programmer's ability to identify performance issues in their code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It might be a good idea to have an active profiler — to push performance data to the programmer instead of waiting for him to come asking for it. For example, the editor could display bottlenecks in red when the programmer edits the source code. Another approach would be to somehow represent what's happening in running programs. This would be an especially big win in server-based applications, where you have lots of running programs to look at. An active profiler could show graphically what's happening in memory as a program's running, or even make sounds that tell what's happening."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can sound serve as an indicator of server issues in a monitoring system?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sound is a good cue to problems. In one place I worked, we had a big board of dials showing what was happening to our web servers. The hands were moved by little servomotors that made a slight noise when they turned. I couldn't see the board from my desk, but I found that I could tell immediately, by the sound, when there was a problem with a server."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How could a profiler help improve algorithm efficiency in computer programs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It might even be possible to write a profiler that would automatically detect inefficient algorithms. I would not be surprised if certain patterns of memory access turned out to be sure signs of bad algorithms. If there were a little guy running around inside the computer executing our programs, he would probably have as long and plaintive a tale to tell about his job as a federal government employee. I often have a feeling that I'm sending the processor on a lot of wild goose chases, but I've never had a good way to look at what it's doing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential advantages of incorporating byte code as an official feature in Lisps?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A number of Lisps now compile into byte code, which is then executed by an interpreter. This is usually done to make the implementation easier to port, but it could be a useful language feature. It might be a good idea to make the byte code an official part of the language, and to allow programmers to use inline byte code in bottlenecks. Then such optimizations would be portable too."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How is the increasing prevalence of server-based applications affecting the perception of speed in computing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The nature of speed, as perceived by the end-user, may be changing. With the rise of server-based applications, more and more programs may turn out to be i/o-bound. It will be worth making i/o fast. The language can help with straightforward measures like simple, fast, formatted output functions, and also with deep structural changes like caching and persistent objects."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the number of simultaneous users per processor a critical factor for server-based applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Users are interested in response time. But another kind of efficiency will be increasingly important: the number of simultaneous users you can support per processor. Many of the interesting applications written in the near future will be server-based, and the number of users per server is the critical question for anyone hosting such applications. In the capital cost of a business offering a server-based application, this is the divisor."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How will the shift to server-based applications impact the efficiency of software and the number of users supported per server?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For years, efficiency hasn't mattered much in most end-user applications. Developers have been able to assume that each user would have an increasingly powerful processor sitting on their desk. And by Parkinson's Law, software has expanded to use the resources available. That will change with server-based applications. In that world, the hardware and software will be supplied together. For companies that offer server-based applications, it will make a very big difference to the bottom line how many users they can support per server."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors should be considered when optimizing performance for applications with multiple users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In some applications, the processor will be the limiting factor, and execution speed will be the most important thing to optimize. But often memory will be the limit; the number of simultaneous users will be determined by the amount of memory you need for each user's data. The language can help here too. Good support for threads will enable all the users to share a single heap. It may also help to have persistent objects and/or language level support for lazy loading."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factor contributes significantly to the popularity and adoption of a programming language among developers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The last ingredient a popular language needs is time. No one wants to write programs in a language that might go away, as so many programming languages do. So most hackers will tend to wait until a language has been around for a couple years before even considering using it."}]}

A friend of mine rarely does anything the first time someone asks him. He knows that people sometimes ask for things that they turn out not to want. To avoid wasting his time, he waits till the third or fourth time he's asked to do something; by then, whoever's asking him may be fairly annoyed, but at least they probably really do want whatever they're asking for."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might individuals choose to delay their engagement with new technologies or trends?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most people have learned to do a similar sort of filtering on new things they hear about. They don't even start paying attention until they've heard about something ten times. They're perfectly justified: the majority of hot new whatevers do turn out to be a waste of time, and eventually go away. By delaying learning VRML, I avoided having to learn it at all."}]}

They just had us tuned out."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can persistence in sharing your story lead to greater visibility and attention from others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The good news is, simple repetition solves the problem.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it beneficial for new technologies to be initially adopted by a small group of early users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's just as well that it usually takes a while to gain momentum. Most technologies evolve a good deal even after they're first launched — programming languages especially. Nothing could be better, for a new techology, than a few years of being used only by a small number of early adopters. Early adopters are sophisticated and demanding, and quickly flush out whatever flaws remain in your technology. When you only have a few users you can be in close contact with all of them. And early adopters are forgiving when you improve your system, even if this causes some breakage."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the organic growth method of introducing new technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two ways new technology gets introduced: the organic growth method, and the big bang method. The organic growth method is exemplified by the classic seat-of-the-pants underfunded garage startup. A couple guys, working in obscurity, develop some new technology. They launch it with no marketing and initially have only a few (fanatically devoted) users. They continue to improve the technology, and meanwhile their user base grows by word of mouth. Before they know it, they're big."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the big bang method in the context of startup development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other approach, the big bang method, is exemplified by the VC-backed, heavily marketed startup. They rush to develop a product, launch it with great publicity, and immediately (they hope) have a large user base."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of organic growth compared to the big bang approach in technology development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Generally, the garage guys envy the big bang guys. The big bang guys are smooth and confident and respected by the VCs. They can afford the best of everything, and the PR campaign surrounding the launch has the side effect of making them celebrities. The organic growth guys, sitting in their garage, feel poor and unloved. And yet I think they are often mistaken to feel sorry for themselves. Organic growth seems to yield better technology and richer founders than the big bang method. If you look at the dominant technologies today, you'll find that most of them grew organically."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can balancing hope and worry contribute to the success of a project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you can keep hope and worry balanced, they will drive a project forward the same way your two legs drive a bicycle forward. In the first phase of the two-cycle innovation engine, you work furiously on some problem, inspired by your confidence that you'll be able to solve it. In the second phase, you look at what you've done in the cold light of morning, and see all its flaws very clearly. But as long as your critical spirit doesn't outweigh your hope, you'll be able to look at your admittedly incomplete system, and think, how hard can it be to get the rest of the way?, thereby continuing the cycle."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should be considered when managing user feedback and growth in a project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Users are a double-edged sword. They can help you improve your language, but they can also deter you from improving it. So choose your users carefully, and be slow to grow their number. Having users is like optimization: the wise course is to delay it. Also, as a general rule, you can at any given time get away with changing more than you think.

This happens particularly in the interfaces between pieces of software written by two different people. To change the interface both have to agree to change it at once. And so interfaces tend not to change at all, which is a problem because they tend to be one of the most ad hoc parts of any system."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What design approach can help clarify ownership of interfaces in system architecture?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One solution here might be to design systems so that interfaces are horizontal instead of vertical — so that modules are always vertically stacked strata of abstraction. Then the interface will tend to be owned by one of them. The lower of two levels will either be a language in which the upper is written, in which case the lower level will own the interface, or it will be a slave, in which case the interface can be dictated by the upper level."}]}

This comforting illusion may have prevented us from seeing the real problem with Lisp, or at least Common Lisp, which is that it sucks for doing what hackers want to do.

From what little I know about Java, there seem to be a lot of protocols for doing things.  Really good languages aren't like that.  They let you do what you want and get out of the way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the perception of Java as an open-source language contrast with its corporate control?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "8. It's pseudo-hip.  Sun now pretends that Java is a grassroots, open-source language effort like Perl or Python.  This one just happens to be controlled by a giant company.  So the language is likely to have the same drab clunkiness as anything else that comes out of a big company."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors differentiate programming languages preferred by large organizations from those favored by hackers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "9. It's designed for large organizations.  Large organizations have different aims from hackers. They want languages that are (believed to be) suitable for use by large teams of mediocre programmers-- languages with features that, like the speed limiters in U-Haul trucks, prevent fools from doing too much damage.  Hackers don't like a language that talks down to them.  Hackers just want power. Historically, languages designed for large organizations (PL/I, Ada) have lost, while hacker languages (C, Perl) have won.  The reason: today's teenage hacker is tomorrow's CTO."}]}

The programmers I admire most are not, on the whole, captivated by Java.  Who does like Java?  Suits, who don't know one language from another, but know that they keep hearing about Java in the press; programmers at big companies, who are amazed to find that there is something even better than C++; and plug-and-chug undergrads, who are ready to like anything that might get them a job (will this be on the test?).  These people's opinions change with every wind."}]}

Sun's business model is being undermined on two fronts.  Cheap Intel processors, of the same type used in desktop machines, are now more than fast enough for servers.  And FreeBSD seems to be at least as good an OS for servers as Solaris. Sun's advertising implies that you need Sun servers for industrial strength applications.  If this were true, Yahoo would be first in line to buy Suns;  but when I worked there, the servers were all Intel boxes running FreeBSD.  This bodes ill for Sun's future.  If Sun runs into trouble, they could drag Java down with them."}]}

The DoD likes it.  The Defense Department is encouraging developers to use Java. This seems to me the most damning sign of all.  The Defense Department does a fine (though expensive) job of defending the country, but they love plans and procedures and protocols.  Their culture is the opposite of hacker culture; on questions of software they will tend to bet wrong.  The last time the DoD really liked a programming language, it was Ada."}]}

But this is something all programmers have to do.  There are too many technologies out there to learn them all.  You have to learn to judge by outward signs which will be worth your time.  I have likewise cavalierly dismissed Cobol, Ada, Visual Basic, the IBM AS400, VRML, ISO 9000, the SET protocol, VMS, Novell Netware, and CORBA, among others.  They just smelled wrong."}]}

It could be that a language promoted by one big company to undermine another, designed by a committee for a \"mainstream\" audience, hyped to the skies, and beloved of the DoD, happens nonetheless to be a clean, beautiful, powerful language that I would love programming in.  It could be, but it seems very unlikely."}]}
