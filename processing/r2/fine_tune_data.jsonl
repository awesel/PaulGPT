If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the nature of superlinear returns in various aspects of life, and how do they relate to capitalism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules, it would stop being true. However, superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefits to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What concept is essential for understanding the world and achieving ambition?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can't understand the world without understanding the concept of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious, you definitely should, because this will be the wave you surf on."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two fundamental causes of superlinear returns?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell, they reduce to two fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an example of a situation where superlinear returns can be observed, and what factors influence success in that context?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're tricky to grow, which means the difference in outcome between someone who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes successful startups from those that struggle to survive?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates, while most don't. As a result, you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for startups to prioritize growth rate over absolute numbers according to Y Combinator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers. This approach prevents them from being discouraged early on when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them decide what to focus on; you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company. The main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate, you tend to achieve something that grows exponentially."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does YC's approach suggest a relationship between growth rate and founder performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate \"you get out what you put in,\" but it's not far from the truth. If growth rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance would also increase accordingly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people find exponential growth surprising or unnatural?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare us for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who asks the king for a single grain of rice on the first day and doubles the amount each successive day."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do humans lack established customs for dealing with exponential growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What we don't understand, we naturally develop customs to deal with; however, we don't have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle, herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice, grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the term \"winner take all\" illustrate about the relationship between performance and returns in competitive scenarios?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression \"winner take all.\" In a sports match, the relationship between performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets one win whether they do much better or just slightly better."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors can lead to the emergence of thresholds in outcomes besides competition?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The source of the step function is not competition per se; however, it's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations where you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting a target."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do superlinear returns influence competitive dynamics in markets and conflicts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage, which makes them more likely to win in the future. Exponential growth helps you cross thresholds; in a market with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the exponential growth and concentration of fame?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because existing fans bring you new ones. However, the fundamental reason it's so concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the A-list in the average person's head."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the concept of thresholds in learning contribute to exponential growth in knowledge and the discovery of new fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read, you're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did DÃ¼rer and Darwin."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two ways work can compound, and how can learning influence this process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next. That happens, for example, when you're building infrastructure or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why does Silicon Valley maintain a culture that accepts failure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Silicon Valley maintains a culture that accepts failure for several reasons. People in Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure; they'll only continue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. If you are learning, you are, in fact, a good bet: maybe your company didn't grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should yield results eventually."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of continuous learning in achieving exponential growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably treat this as the rule rather than the exception. This yields another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning, you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to explore unconventional or lesser-known topics while learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's important to explore unconventional or lesser-known topics while learning because you shouldn't limit yourself to things that are already known to be valuable. You're learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable, and if you're too strict, you'll lop off the outliers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What principle can be applied to identify opportunities for creating better products in a competitive market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A principle for taking advantage of thresholds includes a test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd buy a better alternative if you made one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach should researchers take to foster genuine curiosity and potentially make new discoveries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Researchers should be driven by curiosity rather than careerism to foster genuine curiosity and potentially make new discoveries. The kinds of inquiries that lead to new discoveries often seem mystifying and perhaps unimportant. If they were both mystifying and obviously important, they would be famous open questions with many people already working on them. Therefore, one heuristic is to give free rein to your curiosity instead of focusing solely on what you're supposed to work on."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the current trends regarding superlinear returns in various fields of work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting one for the ambitious. And there's good news in this department: this territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types of work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns themselves are growing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the necessity of being part of an organization for ambitious projects changed over the past fifty years?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fifty years ago, it was much more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and the only way to get distribution. So in 1970, your prestige was, in most cases, the prestige of the organization you belonged to. Prestige was an accurate predictor because if you weren't part of an organization, you weren't likely to achieve much. There were a handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the landscape of opportunities and freedom for individuals changed in recent years compared to the past?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A world dominated by organizations dampened variation in the returns for performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in my lifetime. Now, a lot more people can have the freedom that artists and writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious projects that don't require much initial funding, and many new ways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who is best suited to pursue superlinear returns in a system with greater outcome variation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more variation in outcomes. This doesn't imply everyone will be better off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly will do worse. That's an important point to bear in mind. Exposing oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for superlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know they're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to risk trying it to find out."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How will the shift away from traditional institutions impact access to opportunities for new individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shift away from traditional institutions won't simply be an exodus of their current inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they would never have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity will be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural version the institutions themselves might have cooked up."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of striving for exceptional work in a competitive environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for performance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because there's less competition at the far endânot just for the obvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well, but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few even try. This means it's not just a bargain to do exceptional work, but a bargain even to try to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to achieving exceptional work and standing out in a competitive environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if you want to be an outlier, you need to get nearly all of them right. For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So, in a world with superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're interested in and to find ways to work on it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When is it most advantageous to pursue high-demand, time-consuming work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It will also be important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example, if there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when you're young and don't yet have children."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does luck influence success when working independently?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Luck is, of course, one other thing you need to be successful. Luck is always a factor, but it's even more significant when you're working on your own rather than as part of an organization. Although there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where preparedness meets opportunity, there's also a component of true chance that you can't do anything about. The solution is to take multiple shots, which is another reason to start taking risks early."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What field is characterized by superlinear returns due to exponential growth and performance thresholds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably science. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined with thresholds at the extreme edge of performanceâliterally at the limits of knowledge."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the disparity in contributions to scientific discovery throughout history?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery that makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies seem mild by comparison. Newton's discoveries were arguably greater than all his contemporaries' combined."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between superlinear returns and inequality in outcomes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return curve, the greater the variation in outcomes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics of a field indicate the potential for superlinear returns?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some fields where a small number of individuals achieve significantly higher success than the majority?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else? Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. In sports, the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds; you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And in some of the other fields (including politics), success is driven largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth. But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for investors to have unique insights about a company's potential for success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers saying things that other people have already said. But it's just as true in investing, for example. It's only useful to believe that a company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will already reflect that, and there's no room to make money."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of focusing on initial efforts in the growth of startups and learning processes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the startup world, the name for this principle is \"do things that don't scale.\" If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally, you'll kick off exponential growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything that grows exponentially, such as learning. When you first start learning something, you feel lost. However, it's worth making the initial effort to get a toehold because the more you learn, the easier it will get."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of work evolved beyond traditional employment in creative and academic fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's another, more subtle lesson in the list of fields with superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the 20th century, the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a result, we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with having a job. Even now, to most people, the phrase \"your work\" means their job. But to a writer, artist, or scientist, it means whatever they're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it's part of their portfolio."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between curiosity and success in fields with high potential returns?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately, but you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one. Your curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns if they're not already part of one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do ambition and curiosity play in achieving superlinear returns?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed, the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So, while both ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges arise in defining the concepts of effort, performance, and return in various contexts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thereâs a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort, performance, and return, because theyâre not sharply distinguished in fact. What counts as return to one person might be performance to another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry, theyâre not meaningless. Iâve tried to write about them as precisely as I could without crossing into error."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did knowledge and technique contribute to human life before the Industrial Revolution?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Knowledge did, of course, have a practical effect before the Industrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human life completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad, gradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few exceptionally learned people."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does a step function represent the reward curve for effort in rational decision-making?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not mathematically correct to describe a step function as superlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a superlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort by a rational actor. If it starts at zero, then the part before the step is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after the step must be above the necessary return at that point, or no one would bother."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential benefits and limitations of seeking competition when identifying promising problems to work on?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Seeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that some people find it motivating. It's also somewhat of a guide to promising problems because it's a sign that other people find them promising. However, it's a very imperfect sign: often there's a clamoring crowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by someone quietly working on another one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors can contribute to the popularity of mediocre products or services?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When something is popular despite being mediocre, there's often a hidden reason why. Perhaps a monopoly or regulation makes it hard to compete. Perhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for deciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things that exist for such reasons."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated you to study painting at art school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I went to art school to study painting mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial part of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least at the mercy of organizations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the emergence of this concept during a time of increasing performance variation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just the moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction, but I don't think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it arose now is that its adherents feel threatened by rapidly increasing variation in performance."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What prompted the author to pause their current essay and expand a specific paragraph into its own piece?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As soon as I wrote it, I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear returns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its own. Practically nothing remains of the original version because, after I finished \"How to Do Great Work,\" I rewrote it based on that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the method of acquiring wealth evolved from the pre-Industrial Revolution era to modern advanced economies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Before the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually did it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful and enabled them to capture more. Now it can be done like a scientist, by discovering or building something uniquely valuable. Most people who get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most advanced economies, the ratio has changed significantly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do conventional-minded individuals often perceive high performance variation as a result of cheating or external factors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not surprising that conventional-minded people would dislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest drivers of it. But it's not simply that they don't want anyone to have what they can't. The conventional-minded literally can't imagine what it's like to have novel ideas. So, the whole phenomenon of great variation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they encounter it, they assume it must be due to cheating or to some malign external influence."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of collecting lists of techniques from various fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The purpose of collecting lists of techniques from various fields is to explore what the intersection of these techniques looks like. I decided to find out by creating such a compilation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the goals behind creating the guide on the intersection of various fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Partly, my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the intersection. One thing this exercise shows is that it does have a definite shape; it's not just a point labeled \"work hard.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities should you consider when selecting a project to work on?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, something you have a deep interest in, and something that offers scope to do great work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should ambitious individuals focus on when pursuing their goals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In practice, you don't have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are, if anything, already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do young people face when trying to determine their future career paths?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When you're young, you don't know what you're good at or what different kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet. So, while some people know what they want to do at 14, most have to figure it out."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the best approach to determine what projects or areas to focus on when unsure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to focus on personal projects in your work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let \"work\" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your part of it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria should you consider when choosing projects throughout different stages of life?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What should your projects be? Whatever seems excitingly ambitious to you. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge. At 7, it may seem excitingly ambitious to build huge things out of Lego; then at 14, to teach yourself calculus; until at 21, you're starting to explore unanswered questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does curiosity play in driving and guiding great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you do after discovering a deep interest in a subject to advance your understanding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance, its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of questioning assumptions in making new discoveries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill because your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is strangeness considered a valuable quality in great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math. It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears, embrace it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to pursue unconventional ideas even when others show disinterest?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren't interested in them â in fact, especially if they aren't. If you're excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking, that's as good a bet as you'll find."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the process for making significant contributions in any field?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, and explore promising ones.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to work on something you are deeply interested in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do individuals face when deciding on a career path?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Deciding on a career path presents several challenges. The main reason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. This means the four steps of career exploration overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it. In the meantime, you're not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So, in the worst case, you choose late based on very incomplete information."}]}

Ambition comes in two forms: one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do educational systems often misrepresent the ease of committing to a career path?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The educational systems in most countries misrepresent the ease of committing to a career path. They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it's really like. As a result, an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often appear to the system as an instance of breakage."}]}

They don't tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does."}]}

You need to take action. However, there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting or by reading a book they happen to pick up. Therefore, you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, and ask lots of questions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you prioritize when exploring new fields of study?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So, you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're like. But a field should become clearer as you explore it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it beneficial to have unique interests and tastes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than other people.

Additionally, you're more likely to find new things if you're looking where few have looked before."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key principle to consider when writing a story that will resonate with readers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The key principle to consider when writing a story that will resonate with readers is to follow the excitement rule. Obviously, the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong. Instead of making what they want, they try to create what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you're lost."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you prioritize when deciding what projects to pursue?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're trying to figure out what to work on: pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, and eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does pursuing your interests require beyond mere enthusiasm?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice, it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure, so it does take a good deal of boldness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the recommended approach for achieving great work according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning. In most cases, the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of planning when it comes to achieving unexpected discoveries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach do successful individuals often take to achieve great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much.

The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for four or five hours a day."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to have contiguous blocks of time for focused work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ideally, those hours will be contiguous.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies can help overcome the initial resistance to starting a task?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the sense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's okay to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy can help overcome reluctance to start work in the morning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn't.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to complete projects even when they require more effort than anticipated?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is important to finish what you start, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects, a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the potential benefit of exaggerating the importance of your work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what you're working on, at least in your own mind.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the different forms of procrastination, and which one is considered more dangerous?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two senses of starting work â per day and per project â and therefore, there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project procrastination is far more dangerous. You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't quite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What makes per-project procrastination particularly deceptive compared to per-day procrastination?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around doing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So, per-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You're too busy to notice it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one ensure they are focusing on their true passions as they age?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on? When you're young, it's okay if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset is necessary to appreciate the time investment required for great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key to achieving great work according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in. There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens. When you pause to take stock, you're surprised how far you've come."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does consistency contribute to achieving significant goals over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day, you'll write a book a year. That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day; they get something done, rather than nothing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some examples of activities that lead to exponential growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more. Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans theyâll bring you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often underestimate the impact of exponential growth in its early stages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential curve. However, we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often underestimate the value of investing in exponential growth during the initial phase?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. However, since we underestimate exponential growth early on, this is often done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can undirected thinking contribute to problem-solving?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Work doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking, taking a shower, or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can daydreaming enhance creativity and problem-solving in the context of focused work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this phenomenon, though. You can't just walk around daydreaming. The daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds it questions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of developing a discerning taste in your professional field?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is aiming to be the best considered essential for achieving success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What you're aiming for is essential because if you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good. This observation has been made by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth thinking about why it's true. It could be because ambition is a phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction â where almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short. Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively different thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is simply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can striving to be the best lead to unexpected benefits and simplifications in one's efforts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fortunately, there's a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might seem like you'd be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the best, in practice, you often end up net ahead. It's exciting and also strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways, it's easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a strategy for creating lasting impact in your work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter more than your contemporaries', but because something that still seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can young people overcome feelings of insignificance and build their identity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They often feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that problem because it's self-solving if you work on sufficiently ambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you're not a nobody; you're the person who did it. So just do the work, and your identity will take care of itself."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a positive way to express the idea of avoiding affectation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Avoid affectation\" is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how would you express this idea positively? How would you say what to be, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you're earnest, you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar vices."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of intellectual honesty in the pursuit of new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We're taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue â as a kind of sacrifice. But in fact, it's a source of power too. To see new ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You're trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can you have a sharp eye for the truth if you're intellectually dishonest?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can admitting mistakes contribute to intellectual honesty?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing to admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken about something, you're free. Until then, you have to carry it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does informality play in expressing earnestness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another, more subtle component of earnestness is informality. Informality is much more important than its grammatically negative name implies. It's not merely the absence of something; it means focusing on what matters instead of what doesn't."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do formality and affectation impact the quality of work compared to the approach taken by \"nerds\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Formality and affectation have in common that, as well as doing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way while doing it. However, any energy that goes into how you seem detracts from the quality of the work. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in producing great work: they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact, that's basically the definition of a nerd."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset or attitude is essential for achieving great work, according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need in doing great work. It's not learned; it's preserved from childhood. So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms of them. \"It's easy to criticize\" is true in the most literal sense, and the route to great work is never easy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the value of optimism in the pursuit of great work, despite the risks involved?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There may be some jobs where it's an advantage to be cynical and pessimistic, but if you want to do great work, it's an advantage to be optimistic, even though that means you'll risk looking like a fool sometimes. There's an old tradition of doing the opposite. The Old Testament says it's better to keep quiet lest you look like a fool. But that's advice for those who may not aspire to greatness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is earnestness considered essential for achieving great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some people are naturally earnest, and for others, it takes a conscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. However, I doubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest. It's so hard to do even if you are. You don't have enough margin for error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected, intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one determine the best decision while working on a project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself. It's usually all of a piece. So, if you face a decision in the middle of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset shift can help overcome resistance to making necessary changes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won't necessarily have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some effort; when there's something you need to redo, status quo bias and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat this, ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert to what I have now?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it beneficial to simplify a task to its fundamental components?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, in some kinds of work, it's good to strip whatever you're doing to its essence.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between mathematical elegance and artistic elegance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor drawn from the arts. That's what I thought when I first heard the term \"elegant\" applied to a proof. But now I suspect it's conceptually prior â that the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical elegance. At any rate, it's a useful standard well beyond math."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might complicated solutions be more valued in the short term compared to elegant ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will often have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of effort, and they're hard to understand, both of which impress people, at least temporarily."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean when a creative process feels more like discovery than creation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively little effort, because it was, in a sense, already there. It didn't have to be built, just seen. It's a very good sign when it's hard to say whether you're creating something or discovering it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset should you adopt when engaging in work that involves both creation and discovery?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you're doing work that could be seen as either creation or discovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself as a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between choosing a problem to work on and the process of exploration in research?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problem to work on. This is usually seen as a search, but in the best case, it's more like creating something. In the best case, you create the field in the process of exploring it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to minimize restrictions when designing powerful tools?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Similarly, if you're trying to build a powerful tool, make it gratuitously unrestrictive.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities make an idea valuable for future development and exploration by others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something others can build on. So it's a good sign if you're creating ideas that others could use or exposing questions that others could answer. The best ideas have implications in many different areas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities do great ideas need to possess in order to be impactful?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great ideas need to be both true and new. It takes a certain amount of ability to see new ideas, even once you've learned enough to reach one of the frontiers of knowledge."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the concept of the creative process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've never liked the term \"creative process.\" It seems misleading. Originality isn't a process but a habit of mind. Original thinkers throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle grinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one increase the likelihood of generating original ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there are definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For example, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're working on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have original ideas; they come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of expressing your thoughts through talking or writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good way to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you. Indeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can changing your environment influence your creativity and idea generation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you'll often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit; sometimes it's enough just to go for a walk."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can exploring diverse topics enhance creativity and idea generation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exploring diverse topics helps to travel in topic space. You'll have more new ideas if you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives the angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because analogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do curiosity and originality influence each other in the creative process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds originality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship is closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality; it's roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since questions, at their best, are a big component of answers, curiosity, at its best, is a creative force."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it difficult to generate new ideas despite them seeming obvious once recognized?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet, empirically, having new ideas is hard. What's the source of this apparent contradiction? It's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world. We see the world through models that both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard. That's how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover: they're easy to see after you do something hard."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one identify flawed models of understanding in their worldview?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other people. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where they clash against reality. Most people don't want to see these clues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached to their current model; it's what they think in, so they'll tend to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous it may seem in retrospect."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach did Einstein take to discover new ideas in physics?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find new ideas, you have to seize on signs of breakage instead of looking away. That's what Einstein did. He was able to see the wild implications of Maxwell's equations not so much because he was looking for new ideas, but because he was stricter."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to be willing to break rules when trying to develop a new model of the world?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps to be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the point of view of the old model, which everyone, including you, initially shares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do successful new ideas often appear more conservative in hindsight?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required because new ideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They appear perfectly reasonable once you're using the new model of the world they brought with them. However, they did not seem reasonable at the time; it took the greater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally accepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics differentiate a promising new idea from one that is simply bad?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to most people, or someone would have already explored it. So what you're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of crazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty. Often, ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of crazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications, whereas ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two types of independence described in relation to breaking rules?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy breaking them and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases being aggressively and passively independent-minded."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates aggressively independent-minded individuals to pursue audacious projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules don't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it started."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can a lack of awareness of established norms contribute to innovation and new discoveries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions acts as a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs. Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can overcoming subconscious filters lead to the discovery of innovative ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An overlooked idea often doesn't lose until the semifinals. You do see it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious shoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much work, or too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if you could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a strategy for uncovering valuable ideas that may be hidden due to prevailing misconceptions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other direction: by starting from what's obscuring them. Every cherished but mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable ideas that are unexplored because they contradict it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What value can be found in the overlooked ideas of religions, according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. Therefore, anything that can be described either literally or metaphorically as a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow. Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do individuals often lack originality in choosing the problems they focus on?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who would never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might individuals be more cautious in selecting problems to tackle compared to solutions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than solutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But even so, I think most people are too conservative. They're not merely responding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems are undervalued."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you consider when pursuing research in a field that seems fully explored?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problems is the problem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn't. Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its latent potential. DÃ¼rer and Watt both did this. So if you're interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of focusing on unfashionable problems in work or research?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There's no hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied elsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity, and there's a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that would otherwise be wasted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one identify overlooked problems that are often deemed less significant?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly unfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn't seem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these? By being self-indulgent â by letting your curiosity have its way and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head that says you should only be working on \"important\" problems."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you consider when looking for important problems to work on?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is too conservative about what counts as one. If there's an important but overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it's probably already on your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you were going to take a break from \"serious\" work to work on something just because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The answer is probably more important than it seems."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the choice of problems to work on considered crucial for innovation and discovery?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than originality in solving them. That's what distinguishes the people who discover whole new fields. So, what might seem to be merely the initial step â deciding what to work on â is, in a sense, the key to the whole game."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common misconception about the nature of big ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas is the ratio of question to answer in their composition. People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight is in the question."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are questions often undervalued in educational settings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used in schools. In schools, they tend to exist only briefly before being answered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery. How do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to Earth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By even asking such questions, you are already in excitingly novel territory."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential benefits of holding onto unanswered questions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around with you. However, the more you carry, the greater the chance of noticing a solution â or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing that two unanswered questions are the same."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to revisit questions from our childhood?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before â in your childhood, even â and couldn't stop thinking about. People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful questions alive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between expertise and uncertainty according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from the popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are certain. But actually, the more puzzled you are, the better, so long as (a) the things you're puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else understands them either."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does puzzlement play in the process of discovering new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Think about what's happening at the moment just before a new idea is discovered. Often, someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled about something, which means that originality consists partly of puzzlement â of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with the world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do unanswered questions contribute to the pursuit of knowledge?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. This is one of those situations where the rich get richer because the best way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones. Questions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the process of answering questions lead to deeper insights?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it just gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict that. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to predict how much will unravel if you pull on it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it beneficial to explore multiple small ideas or projects rather than focusing solely on one?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's better to be promiscuously curious â to pull a little bit on a lot of threads and see what happens. Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So, start lots of small things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to embrace a wide range of experiences and ideas in the creative process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try, the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand, though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things that don't work. You can't have a lot of good ideas without also having a lot of bad ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach can enhance learning and enjoyment when tackling new projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything that's been done before, you'll learn faster and have more fun by trying things. And you'll understand previous work better when you do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like two puzzle pieces."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the process for achieving greatness in a project or idea?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it, and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could have planned."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to create successive versions of a product when designing for an audience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're creating something for people â to get an initial version in front of them quickly and then evolve it based on their response."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it indicate when an early version of a new project is referred to as a \"toy\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An early version of a new project is sometimes dismissed as a \"toy.\" It's a good sign when people do this. That means it has everything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the drawbacks of planning in project management, and how can flexibility reduce the need for it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Planning, per se, isn't good. It's sometimes necessary, but it's a necessary evil â a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something you have to do because you're working with inflexible media or because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between risk and reward in an efficient market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In an efficient market, risk is proportionate to reward, so take as much risk as you can afford. Don't look for certainty, but for a bet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally, you're probably being too conservative."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What benefits can come from working on a challenging project, even if it doesn't succeed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working on it, you'll have crossed territory few others have seen and encountered questions few others have asked. And there's probably no better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying to do something slightly too hard."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key advantages of youth and age, and how can one leverage them throughout life?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy, time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge, efficiency, money, and power. With effort, you can acquire some of the latter when young and keep some of the former when old."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantages do young people have that they may not fully appreciate?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they have. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest is probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time. The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly frivolous ways: to learn about something you don't need to know about just out of curiosity, or to try building something just because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinction does the author make between spending time on uncertain pursuits versus clearly wasteful activities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That \"slightly\" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly when you're young, but don't simply waste it. There's a big difference between doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing something you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet, and possibly a better one than you think."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unique perspective does inexperience provide when encountering new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience, is that you're seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain embraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don't fit together perfectly. Usually, the problem is with your brain, but occasionally it's with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly and jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the idea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies can help learners identify potential gaps or misconceptions in their understanding of a new subject?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you're learning about something for the first time, pay attention to things that seem wrong or missing. You'll be tempted to ignore them since there's a 99% chance the problem is with you. You may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep progressing, but don't forget about them. When you've gotten further into the subject, come back and check if they're still there. If they're still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they probably represent an undiscovered idea."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common issue young people face regarding their concerns and priorities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Young people often have to worry about many things. They know all the issues that could matter, but they do not understand their relative importance. As a result, they worry equally about everything, when they should focus much more on a few key concerns and hardly at all about the rest."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the challenges of inexperience that can hinder one's ability to succeed in adulthood?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But what you don't know is only half the problem with inexperience. The other half is what you do know that isn't so. You arrive at adulthood with your head full of nonsense â bad habits you've acquired and false things you've been taught â and you won't be able to do great work until you clear away at least the nonsense in the way of whatever type of work you want to do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do schools influence our perceptions of learning and thinking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools. We're so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school as identical with learning. In fact, schools have all sorts of strange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do traditional school structures affect student engagement and learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child, there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you what you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither classes nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they're just artifacts of the way schools are usually designed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can students take more ownership of their education to enhance their learning experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you're still in school, try thinking of your education as your project and your teachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem a stretch, but it's not merely some weird thought experiment. It's the truth economically, and in the best case, it's the truth intellectually as well. The best teachers don't want to be your bosses. They'd prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source of advice rather than being pulled by them through the material."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the challenges faced in school differ from those encountered in real-world work environments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like. In school, they tell you what the problems are, and they're almost always soluble using no more than you've been taught so far. In real life, you have to figure out what the problems are, and you often don't know if they're soluble at all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a fundamental flaw in the way schools prepare students for success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win by hacking the test. You can't do great work by doing that. You can't trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way to beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others have overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset should you adopt to increase your chances of success in your career?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you a \"big break.\" Even if this were true, the best way to get it would be to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential people."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should one keep in mind when facing rejection from admissions or prize committees?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that impress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different from those required to do great work. The decisions of selection committees are only meaningful to the extent that they're part of a feedback loop, and very few are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does copying existing work play in the learning process for newcomers in a field?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing inherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how something works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does copying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes productive copying from detrimental copying in creative work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thereâs a good way to copy and a bad way. If youâre going to copy something, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still, unconsciously. This is whatâs meant by the famously misattributed phrase âGreat artists steal.â The really dangerous kind of copying, the kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind thatâs done without realizing it, because youâre nothing more than a train running on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other extreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it common for early work in many fields to be influenced by the work of others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In many fields, it's almost inevitable that your early work will be, in some sense, based on other people's. Projects rarely arise in a vacuum; they're usually a reaction to previous work. When you're first starting out, you don't have any previous work; if you're going to react to something, it has to be someone else's. Once you're established, you can react to your own. But while the former gets called derivative and the latter doesn't, structurally, the two cases are more similar than they seem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the perception of novelty in new ideas lead to misconceptions about their originality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes makes them seem, at first, to be more derivative than they are. New discoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of existing things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential risks of relying on copying as a method of learning or innovation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that you'll tend to copy old thingsâthings that were, in their day, at the frontier of knowledge but no longer are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you consider when imitating someone else's style or features?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you imitate someone else's style or features, consider that you shouldn't copy every aspect of it. Some features may make you look ridiculous if you do. For example, don't adopt the mannerisms of an eminent 50-year-old professor if you're only 18, or the idiom of a Renaissance poem from hundreds of years ago."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What misconception might inexperienced individuals have about the relationship between talent and behavior?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are jerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that being a jerk is part of being talented. It isn't; being talented is merely how they get away with it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can exploring ideas from different fields enhance creativity and innovation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries of this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can negative examples contribute to valuable learning experiences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact, you can sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things done well; sometimes it only becomes clear what's needed when it's missing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it beneficial to spend time in environments with highly accomplished individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If many of the best people in your field are gathered in one place, it's usually a good idea to spend some time there. It will increase your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people are human, it will boost your self-confidence."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can showing genuine interest influence your interactions with experts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're earnest, you'll probably get a warmer welcome than you might expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy to talk about it with anyone who's genuinely interested. If they're really good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist's interest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their hobbies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the perception of research quality differ among various departments in universities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It may take some effort to find the people who are really good, though. Doing great work has such prestige that, in some places, particularly universities, there's a polite fiction that everyone is engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities can't say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in different departments varies immensely. Some departments have people doing great work; others have in the past; others never have."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to collaborate with colleagues, even on individual projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't be done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is having a few exceptional colleagues more beneficial than having many average ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good ones. In fact, it's not merely better but necessary, judging from history: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests that one's colleagues often make the difference between doing great work and not."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it indicate about your professional environment if you have colleagues who challenge you and offer unique insights?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Insights from colleagues who challenge you can indicate a dynamic professional environment. They can see and do things that you can't. So, if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep you on your toes in this sense, you're probably over the threshold."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to maintain high morale when working on ambitious projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Husband your morale. It's the basis of everything when you're working on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a living organism."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does one's perspective on life affect their work performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Morale starts with your view of life. You're more likely to do great work if you're an optimist and more likely to succeed if you think of yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can engaging in meaningful work help individuals cope with personal challenges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, work can, to some extent, protect you from your problems. If you choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a refuge from the challenges of everyday life. If this is escapism, it's a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by some of the greatest minds in history."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the relationship between morale and work performance influence productivity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which increases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this cycle also operates in the other direction: if you're not doing good work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to perform well. Since it matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when you're stuck, just so you start to get something done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can ambitious individuals maintain their morale in the face of setbacks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting. You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always involves some backtracking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a more nuanced approach to handling setbacks without giving up?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Never give up\" is also not quite right. Obviously, there are times when it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would be: never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to. Corollary: never abandon the root node."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one differentiate between productive struggle and harmful pain in their work or activities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more than it's a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends on how fast you're running. So, learn to distinguish good pain from bad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How important is the size of an audience for sustaining morale in creative fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An audience is a critical component of morale. If you're a scholar, your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience in the traditional sense. Either way, it doesn't need to be big. The value of an audience doesn't grow anything like linearly with its size. Which is bad news if you're famous, but good news if you're just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people genuinely love what you're doing, that's enough."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can avoiding intermediaries impact your connection with your audience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between you and your audience. In some types of work, this is inevitable, but it's so liberating to escape it that you might be better off switching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the company you keep impact your overall morale and energy levels?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your morale. You'll find there are some who increase your energy and others who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always what you'd expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and avoid those who decrease it. Though, of course, if there's someone you need to take care of, that takes precedence."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to choose a partner who supports your ambition and work commitment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're ambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition. So, someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you or does and doesn't care."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some key practices to maintain good morale?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ultimately, morale is physical. You think with your body, so it's important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of drugs.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How should one prioritize whose opinions to value when seeking to impress others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's okay to want to impress other people, but choose the right people. The opinion of people you respect is a signal. Fame, which is the opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just adds noise."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a more important factor to consider about a type of work than its prestige?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The prestige of a type of work is, at best, a trailing indicator and sometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of work is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can competition influence your approach to problem-solving?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose the problem for you; don't let yourself get drawn into chasing something just because others are. In fact, don't let competitors make you do anything much more specific than work harder."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does curiosity play a role in achieving great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the length of this essay suggest about the reader's commitment to doing great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could. But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it this far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so, you're already further along than you might realize because the set of people willing to want to is small."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What two key factors should you focus on to achieve great work, aside from luck and effort?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal, mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and luck. Luck, by definition, you can't do anything about, so we can ignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to do great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest. Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key to discovering the type of work that suits you best?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are grounds for optimism. There are so many different ways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered. Out of all those different types of work, the one you're most suited for is probably a pretty close matchâprobably a comically close match. It's just a question of finding it and how far into it your ability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by trying."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological factors prevent individuals from pursuing their potential for greatness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds them back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous to try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely, if you tried something like that, you'd fail. Presumably, the calculation is rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do great work. But that's what's going on subconsciously; they shy away from the question."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What attitude can help make hard work feel less burdensome?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you'll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to work hard.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on defining and recognizing great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't think you could give a precise definition of what counts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. But there's no threshold for importance. It's a matter of degree and often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I'd rather people focused on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether they're important or not. Just try to do something amazing and leave it to future generations to say if you succeeded."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do everyday observations play in the creation of standup comedy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in everyday life. \"Did you ever notice...?\" New ideas come from doing this about nontrivial things, which may help explain why people's reaction to a new idea is often the first half of laughing: Ha!"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes genuine enthusiasm for an unconventional idea from being viewed as a crank?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That second qualifier is critical.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges might one face when trying to identify a meaningful project or problem to work on?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding a match between the current version of you and a list of known problems. You'll often have to co-evolve with the problem. That's why it can sometimes be so hard to figure out what to work on. The search space is huge; it's the Cartesian product of all possible types of work, both known and yet to be discovered, and all possible future versions of you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are curious people more likely to excel in their work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do great work, but one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide net, they are more likely to find the right thing to work on in the first place."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential risks of creating content for an audience perceived as less sophisticated?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you feel is less sophisticated than you if that causes you to talk down to them.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the challenges of pursuing a career aligned with your passions while also needing to earn a living?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can't usually get paid for doing exactly what you want, especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side. Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach, your work is compromised by default, and in the second, you have to fight to get time to do it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key principle for achieving greatness according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There may be some very unworldly people who do great work without consciously trying to.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria should beliefs meet to be considered safe and unquestionable?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable if and only if they're also unfalsifiable. For example, it's safe to have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under the law because a sentence with a \"should\" in it isn't really a statement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And if there's no evidence that could disprove one of your principles, there can't be any facts you'd need to ignore in order to preserve it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between affectation and intellectual dishonesty in terms of their persistence and nature?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty. Affectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in time, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it imply when a project is dismissed as a \"toy\" in terms of the validity of criticism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Attacking a project as a \"toy\" is similar to attacking a statement as \"inappropriate.\" It means that no more substantial criticism can be made to stick."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can you determine if an activity is a productive use of your time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to tell whether you're wasting time is to ask if you're producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely to be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where you create something is less likely to be a waste of time than playing games where you don't."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Under what conditions might the assertion about constrained work in projects like SETI@home or Bitcoin be considered false?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This assertion is false when the work that other people have to do is very constrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible to expand the area in which it's false by defining similarly restricted protocols with more freedom of action in the nodes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might walking or running the same route be beneficial for one's thinking process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It may be helpful to always walk or run the same route because that frees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and there is some historical evidence for it."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an effective method for generating new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The way to get new ideas is to notice anomalies: what seems strange, or missing, or broken?

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the exploration of knowledge gaps contribute to the growth of understanding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Knowledge grows fractally. From a distance, its edges look smooth, but when you learn enough to get close to one, you'll notice it's full of gaps. These gaps will seem obvious; it will seem inexplicable that no one has tried x or wondered about y. In the best case, exploring such gaps yields whole new fractal buds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What alternative methods of knowledge acquisition are depicted in science fiction literature?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the science fiction books I read as a kid, reading was often replaced by some more efficient way of acquiring knowledge. Mysterious \"tapes\" would load it into one's brain like a program being loaded into a computer."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is reading considered an essential skill that cannot easily be replaced?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reading is considered an essential skill that cannot easily be replaced. Not just because it would be hard to build a replacement for reading, but because even if one existed, it would be insufficient. Reading about a subject doesn't just teach you about that subject; it also teaches you how to write."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unique insights can a writer gain from the process of writing itself?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A good writer doesn't just think and then write down what he thought as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always discover new things in the process of writing. And there is, as far as I know, no substitute for this kind of discovery. Talking about your ideas with other people is a good way to develop them. But even after doing this, you'll find you still discover new things when you sit down to write. There is a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does writing influence problem-solving, particularly for complex issues?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are, of course, kinds of thinking that can be done without writing. If you don't need to go too deeply into a problem, you can solve it without writing. If you're thinking about how two pieces of machinery should fit together, writing about it probably won't help much. And when a problem can be described formally, you can sometimes solve it in your head. But if you need to solve a complicated, ill-defined problem, it will almost always help to write about it. Which, in turn, means that someone who's not good at writing will almost always be at a disadvantage in solving such problems."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are reading and writing interconnected in the process of thinking effectively?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can't think well without writing well, and you can't write well without reading well.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean to be truly \"good at reading\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By \"good at reading,\" I don't mean good at the mechanics of reading.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can people's desires and preferences change over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason this is mistaken is that people do sometimes change what they want.

And people who want to want somethingâwho want to like classical music or broccoliâsometimes succeed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What fundamental truths might intelligent beings in the universe share with humans beyond mathematics and physics?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If there were intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, they'd share certain truths in common with us. The truths of mathematics would be the same because they're true by definition. Ditto for the truths of physics; the mass of a carbon atom would be the same on their planet. However, I think we'd share other truths with aliens besides the truths of math and physics, and it would be worthwhile to think about what these might be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common principles and beliefs might humans and aliens share regarding experimentation, learning, and logical reasoning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, I think we'd share the principle that a controlled experiment testing some hypothesis entitles us to have proportionally increased belief in it. It seems fairly likely, too, that it would be true for aliens that one can get better at something by practicing. We'd probably share Occam's razor. There doesn't seem to be anything specifically human about any of these ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of the concept of alien truth in understanding common truths among intelligent life forms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We can only guess, of course. We can't say for sure what forms intelligent life might take. Nor is it my goal here to explore that question, interesting though it is. The point of the idea of alien truth is not that it gives us a way to speculate about what forms intelligent life might take, but that it gives us a threshold, or more precisely a target, for truth. If you're trying to find the most general truths short of those of math or physics, then presumably they'll be those we'd share in common with other forms of intelligent life."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to adopt a generous perspective when considering the concepts that may be relevant to alien intelligence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alien truth will work best as a heuristic if we err on the side of generosity. If an idea might plausibly be relevant to aliens, that's enough. Justice, for example. I wouldn't want to bet that all intelligent beings would understand the concept of justice, but I wouldn't want to bet against it either."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the concept of alien truth suggest about the nature of knowledge beyond mathematics?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The idea of alien truth is related to ErdÅs's concept of God's book. He used to describe a particularly good proof as being in God's book, the implication being (a) that a sufficiently good proof was more discovered than invented, and (b) that its goodness would be universally recognized. If there's such a thing as alien truth, then there's more in God's book than math."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What term best encompasses the pursuit of understanding extraterrestrial existence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What should we call the search for alien truth? The obvious choice is \"philosophy.\" Whatever else philosophy includes, it should probably include this. I'm fairly sure Aristotle would have thought so. One could even make the case that the search for alien truth is, if not an accurate description, at least a significant aspect of philosophical inquiry."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common challenges do startups face regardless of their industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first thing that came to mind was that most startups have the same problems. No two have exactly the same problems, but it's surprising how much the problems remain the same, regardless of what they're making. Once you've advised 100 startups, all doing different things, you rarely encounter problems you haven't seen before."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unique advantage do YC partners have compared to later stage investors in recognizing recurring startup challenges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This fact is one of the things that makes YC work. But I didn't know it when we started YC. I only had a few data points: our own startup and those started by friends. It was a surprise to me how often the same problems recur in different forms. Many later stage investors might never realize this because they might not advise 100 startups in their whole career, but a YC partner will get this much experience in the first year or two."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key benefit of investing in a larger number of early-stage companies compared to a smaller number of later-stage companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One key benefit of investing in a larger number of early-stage companies compared to a smaller number of later-stage companies is that you gain a lot of data. This is not only because you're looking at more companies, but also because more goes wrong."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is personalized advice important for startups, despite having knowledge of common challenges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Knowing (nearly) all the problems startups can encounter doesn't mean that advising them can be automated or reduced to a formula. There's no substitute for individual office hours with a YC partner. Each startup is unique, which means they have to be advised by specific partners who know them well."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did Y Combinator face when increasing the size of their startup batches in 2012?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We learned that the hard way in the notorious \"batch that broke YC\" in the summer of 2012. Up until that point, we treated the partners as a pool. When a startup requested office hours, they got the next available slot posted by any partner. That meant every partner had to know every startup. This worked fine for up to 60 startups, but when the batch grew to 80, everything broke. The founders probably didn't realize anything was wrong, but the partners were confused and unhappy because halfway through the batch, they still didn't know all the companies yet."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach did we take to improve the advising process for startups after encountering difficulties with a particular batch?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The solution we adopted was the classic one in these situations. We sharded the batch into smaller groups of startups, each overseen by a dedicated group of partners. That fixed the problem and has worked fine ever since. However, the batch that broke YC was a powerful demonstration of how individualized the process of advising startups has to be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common issues do startups face during mentorship sessions, and how can mentors help prioritize these problems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups often come into mentorship sessions with three problems they are worried about. One is of moderate importance, one doesn't matter at all, and one will kill the company if it isn't addressed immediately. It's like watching one of those horror movies where the heroine is deeply upset that her boyfriend cheated on her, and only mildly curious about the door that's mysteriously ajar. You want to say: never mind about your boyfriend, think about that door! Fortunately, in office hours, you can. So while startups still die with some regularity, it's rarely because they wandered into a room containing a murderer. The YC partners can warn them where the murderers are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do many startup founders fail to heed advice from mentors or advisors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many startup founders fail to heed advice from mentors or advisors because they often do not listen. This was a surprising observation for me: how frequently founders disregard our guidance. A couple of weeks ago, I spoke with a partner who had been working for Y Combinator for a few batches and was starting to notice a pattern. \"They come back a year later,\" she said, \"and say, 'We wish we'd listened to you.'\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the counterintuitive nature of startups beneficial for Y Combinator's approach to advising founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they're so different from most people's other experiences. No one knows what it's like except those who've done it, which is why YC partners should usually have been founders themselves. But strangely enough, the counterintuitiveness of startups turns out to be another of the things that make YC work. If it weren't counterintuitive, founders wouldn't need our advice about how to do it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is focus crucial for early stage startups, and how does Y Combinator help them prioritize their challenges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Focus is doubly important for early-stage startups because not only do they have a hundred different problems, but they also don't have anyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders focus on things that don't matter, there's no one focusing on the things that do. So the essence of what happens at YC is to figure out which problems matter most, then cook up ideas for solving them â ideally at a resolution of a week or less â and then try those ideas and measure how well they worked. The focus is on action, with measurable, near-term results."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can founders effectively navigate decision-making while adapting to changes in their business environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This doesn't imply that founders should rush forward regardless of the consequences. If you correct course at a high enough frequency, you can be simultaneously decisive at a micro scale and tentative at a macro scale. The result is a somewhat winding path, but executed very rapidly, like the path a running back takes downfield. In practice, there's less backtracking than you might expect. Founders usually guess right about which direction to run in, especially if they have someone experienced, like a YC partner, to bounce their hypotheses off. When they guess wrong, they notice quickly because they'll talk about the results at office hours the next week."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does improving navigational ability contribute to the speed of startup growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A small improvement in navigational ability can make you a lot faster because it has a double effect: the path is shorter, and you can travel faster along it when you're more certain it's the right one. That's where a lot of YC's value lies, in helping founders get an extra increment of focus that lets them move faster. And since moving fast is the essence of a startup, YC, in effect, makes startups more startup-like."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenge do startup founders face when adapting to the expectations of accelerator programs like Y Combinator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Instead of actually doing whatever it's supposed to measure, that stops working when you start a startup. So part of what YC does is retrain founders to stop trying to hack the test. It takes a surprisingly long time; a year in, you still see them reverting to their old habits."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between the knowledge of YC partners and founders, and how does it benefit experienced founders participating in Y Combinator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "YC is not simply more experienced founders passing on their knowledge; it's more like specialization than apprenticeship. The knowledge of the YC partners and the founders has different shapes: it wouldn't be worthwhile for a founder to acquire the encyclopedic knowledge of startup problems that a YC partner has, just as it wouldn't be worthwhile for a YC partner to acquire the depth of domain knowledge that a founder has. That's why it can still be valuable for an experienced founder to do YC, just as it can still be valuable for an experienced athlete to have a coach."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do good colleagues influence the performance of ambitious individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Under Ross, Bell Labs, Xerox PARC, good colleagues make you better, no matter how skilled you are.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What efforts has YC made to establish itself as a prominent cluster of startup founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whether or not YC manages one day to be listed alongside those famous clusters, it won't be for lack of trying. We are very aware of this historical phenomenon and have deliberately designed YC to be one. By this point, it's not bragging to say that it's the biggest cluster of great startup founders. Even people trying to attack YC concede that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Y Combinator address the challenges faced by startup founders in terms of community and support?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Colleagues and startup founders are two of the most powerful forces in the world, so you'd expect it to have a big effect to combine them. Before YC, to the extent people thought about the question at all, most assumed they couldn't be combined â that loneliness was the price of independence. That was how it felt to us when we started our own startup in Boston in the 1990s. We had a handful of older people we could go to for advice (of varying quality), but no peers. There was no one we could commiserate with about the misbehavior of investors or speculate with about the future of technology. I often tell founders to make something they themselves want, and YC is certainly that: it was designed to be exactly what we wanted when we were starting a startup."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do startups face in securing seed funding, and how does the availability of great colleagues influence this process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One challenge startups face in securing seed funding is the need to navigate through a network of wealthy individuals, which has become a common practice in the US. This process can be daunting and often feels like a commodity. However, having great colleagues can significantly influence this process. Their presence in specific locations creates valuable networks that are not easily replicated, as they are proportionally absent from other areas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unique experience does the author describe when attending a YC dinner with multiple startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Something magical happens where they do cluster, though. The energy in the room at a YC dinner is like nothing else I've experienced. We would have been happy just to have one or two other startups to talk to, but when you have a whole roomful, it's another thing entirely."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the culture of support among YC founders differ from that of traditional educational institutions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "YC founders aren't just inspired by one another; they also help one another. That's the happiest thing I've learned about startup founders: how generous they can be in helping one another. We noticed this in the first batch and consciously designed YC to magnify it. The result is something far more intense than, say, a university. Between the partners, the alumni, and their batchmates, founders are surrounded by people who want to help them and can."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is YC not accurately described as a \"bootcamp\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is why I've never liked it when people refer to YC as a \"bootcamp.\" It's intense like a bootcamp, but the opposite in structure. Instead of everyone doing the same thing, they are each talking to YC partners to figure out what their specific startup needs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does research suggest about people's ability to assess the accuracy of their answers compared to answering questions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This situation reminds me of the research showing that people are much better at answering questions than they are at judging how accurate their answers are.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors determine the optimal unit of decisiveness in decision-making processes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The optimal unit of decisiveness depends on how long it takes to get results, and that depends on the type of problem you're solving. When you're negotiating with investors, it could be a couple of days, whereas if you're building hardware, it could be months."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What conditions allowed Newton to focus on his work without distractions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Supported comfortably, Newton was free to devote himself wholly to whatever he chose. To remain on, he had only to avoid the three unforgivable sins: crime, heresy, and marriage."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does labeling a statement as \"x-ist\" imply about the willingness to engage in further discussion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, when someone calls a statement \"x-ist,\" they're also implicitly saying that this is the end of the discussion. They do not, having said this, go on to consider whether the statement is true or not. Using such labels is the conversational equivalent of signaling an exception. That's one of the reasons they're used: to end a discussion."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you ask someone who frequently uses labels related to discrimination to gauge their perspective on truth and bias?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you find yourself talking to someone who uses these labels a lot, it might be worthwhile to ask them explicitly if they believe any babies are being thrown out with the bathwater. Can a statement be x-ist, for whatever value of x, and also true? If the answer is yes, then they're admitting to banning the truth. That's obvious enough that I'd guess most would answer no. But if they answer no, it's easy to show that they're mistaken, and that in practice, such labels are applied to statements regardless of their truth or falsity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the perception of truth vary based on the speaker's identity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement is considered x-ist often depends on who said it. Truth doesn't work that way. The same statement can't be true when one person says it, but x-ist, and therefore false, when another person does."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes heresies from ordinary opinions in terms of public perception?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other distinctive thing about heresies, compared to ordinary opinions, is that the public expression of them outweighs everything else the speaker has done. In ordinary matters, like knowledge of history or taste in music, you're judged by the average of your opinions. A heresy is qualitatively different; it's like dropping a chunk of uranium onto the scale."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the consequences of expressing unpopular opinions in today's society compared to historical practices of punishing heresy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Back in the day (and still, in some places), the punishment for heresy was death. You could have led a life of exemplary goodness, but if you publicly doubted, say, the divinity of Christ, you were going to burn. Nowadays, in civilized countries, heretics only get fired in the metaphorical sense, by losing their jobs. But the structure of the situation is the same: the heresy outweighs everything else. You could have spent the last ten years saving children's lives, but if you express certain opinions, you're automatically fired."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between a person's past behavior and the consequences of their current actions in the context of guilt and punishment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's much the same as if you committed a crime. No matter how virtuously you've lived, if you commit a crime, you must still suffer the penalty of the law. Having lived a previously blameless life might mitigate the punishment, but it doesn't affect whether you're guilty or not."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between societal reactions to heresy and actual crimes, according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A heresy is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crimeâone that makes some people feel not merely that you're mistaken, but that you should be punished. Indeed, their desire to see you punished is often stronger than it would be if you'd committed an actual crime. There are many on the far left who believe strongly in the reintegration of felons (as I do myself), and yet seem to feel that anyone guilty of certain heresies should never work again."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the landscape of acceptable opinions changed over the past few decades?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are always some heresies â some opinions you'd be punished for expressing. However, there are a lot more acceptable opinions now than there were a few decades ago, and even those who are happy about this would have to agree that it's so."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key components that contribute to the emergence of waves of intolerance in society?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You need two ingredients for a wave of intolerance: intolerant people and an ideology to guide them. The intolerant people are always there; they exist in every sufficiently large society. That's why waves of intolerance can arise so suddenly; all they need is something to set them off."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the characteristics of individuals classified as aggressively conventional-minded?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The aggressively conventional-minded individuals can be classified according to two dimensions: (1) how independent- or conventional-minded they are, and (2) how aggressive they are about it. These individuals are the enforcers of orthodoxy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens when a group of conventionally-minded individuals collectively adopt a shared ideology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Normally, they're only locally visible. They're the grumpy, censorious people in a group â the ones who are always first to complain when something violates the current rules of propriety. But occasionally, like a vector field whose elements become aligned, a large number of aggressively conventional-minded people unite behind some ideology all at once. Then they become much more of a problem because a mob dynamic takes over, where the enthusiasm of each participant is increased by the enthusiasm of the others."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What similarities exist between the late 1980s ideological shift in US universities and the Cultural Revolution?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the late 1980s, a new ideology of this type appeared in US universities. It had a very strong component of moral purity, and the aggressively conventional-minded seized upon it with their usual eagerness â all the more because the relaxation of social norms in the preceding decades meant there had been less and less to forbid. The resulting wave of intolerance has been eerily similar in form to the Cultural Revolution, though fortunately much smaller in magnitude."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What tactic do heretic hunters commonly use to discredit their opponents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've deliberately avoided mentioning any specific heresies here, partly because one of the universal tactics of heretic hunters, now as in the past, is to accuse those who disapprove of the way in which they suppress ideas of being heretics themselves. Indeed, this tactic is so consistent that you could use it as a way of detecting witch hunts in any era."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why does the author choose not to mention specific heresies in the essay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And that's the second reason I've avoided mentioning any specific heresies. I want this essay to work in the future, not just now. Unfortunately, it probably will. The aggressively conventional-minded will always be among us, looking for things to forbid. All they need is an ideology to tell them what. And it's unlikely the current one will be the last."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the state of freedom of expression in western countries changed from the mid-20th century to the present?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fortunately, in western countries, the suppression of heresies is nothing like as bad as it used to be. Though the window of opinions you can express publicly has narrowed in the last decade, it's still much wider than it was a few hundred years ago. The problem is the derivative. Up until about 1985, the window had been growing ever wider. Anyone looking into the future in 1985 would have expected freedom of expression to continue to increase. Instead, it has decreased."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When should society start to be concerned about the actions of extremists regarding vaccination and free speech?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In both cases, it's hard to know how much to worry. Is it really dangerous to society as a whole if a handful of extremists refuse to get their kids vaccinated or shout down speakers at universities? The point to start worrying is presumably when their efforts start to spill over into everyone else's lives. And in both cases, that does seem to be happening."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies can be employed to combat the concept of heresy and promote free expression?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is probably worth spending some amount of effort on pushing back to keep open the window of free expression. My hope is that this essay will help form social antibodies not just against current efforts to suppress ideas, but against the concept of heresy in general. That's the real prize. How do you disable the concept of heresy? Since the Enlightenment, Western societies have discovered many techniques for doing that, but there are surely more to be discovered."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the lack of qualifiers in claims of x-ism suggest about their nature?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another more subtle but equally damning bit of evidence is that claims of x-ism are never qualified. You never hear anyone say that a statement is \"probably x-ist\" or \"almost certainly y-ist.\" If claims of x-ism were actually claims about truth, you'd expect to see \"probably\" in front of \"x-ist\" as often as you see it in front of \"fallacious.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of rules are considered most effective for attracting potential converts in a belief system?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The rules must be strict, but they need not be demanding. The most effective type of rules are those about superficial matters, like doctrinal minutiae or the precise words adherents must use. Such rules can be made extremely complicated and yet don't repel potential converts by requiring significant sacrifice."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might orthodoxy appeal to individuals with questionable morals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The superficial demands of orthodoxy make it an inexpensive substitute for virtue. That, in turn, is one of the reasons orthodoxy is so attractive to bad people. You could be a horrible person, and yet as long as you're orthodox, you're better than everyone who isn't."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the current state of free speech and the suppression of ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fortunately, most of those trying to suppress ideas today still respect Enlightenment principles enough to pay lip service to them. They know they're not supposed to ban ideas per se, so they have to recast the ideas as causing \"harm,\" which sounds like something that can be banned. The more extreme try to claim speech itself is violence, or even that silence is. But, strange as it may sound, such gymnastics are a good sign. We'll know we're really in trouble when they stop bothering to invent pretenses for banning ideas â when, like the medieval church, they say, \"Damn right we're banning ideas, and in fact here's a list of them.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who are the individuals acknowledged for providing feedback on the drafts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To Marc Andreessen, Chris Best, Trevor Blackwell, Nicholas Christakis, Daniel Gackle, Jonathan Haidt, Claire Lehmann, Jessica Livingston, Greg Lukianoff, Robert Morris, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges might a writer face when trying to articulate their thoughts on a familiar topic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to allow ideas to develop while writing an essay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is important to allow ideas to develop while writing an essay to get them exactly right. Your ideas won't just be imprecise, but incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that's why I write them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the process of publishing influence the way we perceive our original ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Once you publish something, the convention is that whatever you wrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your ideas, and now you've expressed them. But you know this isn't true. You know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not just the ideas you published. Presumably, there were others that turned out to be too broken to fix, and those you discarded instead."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "In what contexts can individuals effectively visualize and manipulate complex concepts mentally?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In precisely defined domains, it's possible to form complete ideas in your head. People can play chess in their heads, for example. Mathematicians can do some amount of math in their heads, though they don't seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length until they write it down. But this only seems possible with ideas you can express in a formal language."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do some people engage in the writing process mentally before physically writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Arguably, what such people are doing is putting ideas into words in their heads. I can, to some extent, write essays in my head. I'll sometimes think of a paragraph while walking or lying in bed that survives nearly unchanged in the final version. But really, I'm writing when I do this. I'm doing the mental part of writing; my fingers just aren't moving as I do it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does writing about a subject contribute to deeper understanding and awareness of one's knowledge?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can know a great deal about something without writing about it. Can you ever know so much that you wouldn't learn more from trying to explain what you know? I don't think so. I've written about at least two subjects I know well â Lisp hacking and startups â and in both cases, I learned a lot from writing about them. In both cases, there were things I didn't consciously realize until I had to explain them. And I don't think my experience was anomalous. A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have, if anything, a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the value of writing in the exploration of ideas compared to other methods?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas. If you have ideas about architecture, presumably the best way to explore them is to build actual buildings. What I'm saying is that however much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you'll still learn new things from writing about them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of writing over talking when it comes to expressing ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Putting ideas into words doesn't have to mean writing, of course. You can also do it the old way, by talking. But in my experience, writing is the stricter test. You have to commit to a single, optimal sequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don't have tone of voice to carry meaning. And you can focus in a way that would seem excessive in conversation. I'll often spend two weeks on an essay and reread drafts fifty times. If you did that in conversation, it would seem evidence of some kind of mental disorder. If you're lazy, of course, writing and talking are equally useless. But if you want to push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between writing and the development of fully formed ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason I've spent so long establishing this rather obvious point is that it leads to another that many people will find shocking. If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasn't written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to critically examine one's own thinking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It feels to them as if they do, especially if they're not in the habit of critically examining their own thinking. Ideas can feel complete. It's only when you try to put them into words that you discover they're not. So, if you never subject your ideas to that test, you'll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never realize it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does articulating ideas play in the process of determining their validity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Putting ideas into words is certainly no guarantee that they'll be right. Far from it. But though it's not a sufficient condition, it is a necessary one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the different ways in which communication can be considered a conversation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two senses of talking to someone: a strict sense in which the conversation is verbal, and a more general sense in which it can take any form, including writing. In the limit case (e.g., Seneca's letters), conversation in the latter sense becomes essay writing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What logical reasoning does the author use to challenge the idea that good taste does not exist?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste that it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father was wrong. And that's what I'm going to give you here: a proof by reductio ad absurdum. If we start from the premise that there's no such thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that are obviously false; therefore, the premise must be wrong.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one determine who has better taste in art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because if there is such a thing as good art, it's easy to tell which of two people has better taste. Show them a lot of works by artists they've never seen before and ask them to choose the best; whoever chooses the better art has better taste."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What implications does rejecting the notion of good taste have on the evaluation of art and artists?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also have to discard the concept of good art. That means you have to discard the possibility of people being good at making it. This implies that there is no way for artists to be good at their jobs. Not just visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. You can't have good actors, or novelists, or composers, or dancers either. You can have popular novelists, but not good ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of discarding the concept of good taste in evaluating artistic merit?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We don't realize how far we'd have to go if we discarded the concept of good taste, because we don't even debate the most obvious cases. But it doesn't just mean we can't say which of two famous painters is better; it means we can't say that any painter is better than a randomly chosen eight-year-old."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What led the author to understand the value of skill and good taste in art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That was how I realized my father was wrong. I started studying painting, and it was just like other kinds of work I'd done: you could do it well or badly, and if you tried hard, you could get better at it. It was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini were much better at it than I was. That gap between us was not imaginary; they were so good. If they could be good, then art could be good, and there was such a thing as good taste after all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the perception that good taste in art is subjective and often disputed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now that I've explained how to show there is such a thing as good taste, I should also explain why people think there isn't. There are two reasons. One is that there's always so much disagreement about taste. Most people's response to art is a tangle of unexamined impulses. Is the artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this the sort of art they're supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famous museum or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice, most people's response to art is dominated by such extraneous factors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the nature of artistic taste and its evolution over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The people who claim to have good taste are often mistaken. The paintings admired by the so-called experts in one generation are often so different from those admired a few generations later. It's easy to conclude there's nothing real there at all. It's only when you isolate this force, for example, by trying to paint and comparing your work to Bellini's, that you can see that it does, in fact, exist."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some people question whether art can possess inherent goodness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason people doubt that art can be good is that there doesn't seem to be any room in the art for this goodness. The argument goes like this: imagine several people looking at a work of art and judging how good it is. If being good art really is a property of objects, it should be in the object somehow. But it doesn't seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the heads of each of the observers. And if they disagree, how do you choose between them?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the concepts of \"objective\" and \"subjective\" vary in different contexts of interaction?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The distinction between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" is not binary, but a matter of degree, depending on how much the subjects have in common. Particles interacting with one another are at one pole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at the other; their reactions aren't purely subjective."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the effectiveness of art be compared to that of a vaccine in terms of its impact on individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because people's responses to art aren't random, art can be designed to operate on people and be good or bad depending on how effectively it does so, much like a vaccine. If someone were talking about the ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem very frivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn't really a property of vaccines, because acquiring immunity is something that happens in the immune system of each individual person. Sure, people's immune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not work on another, but that doesn't make it meaningless to talk about the effectiveness of a vaccine."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one assess the effectiveness of art in comparison to more quantifiable fields like medicine?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The situation with art is messier, of course. You can't measure effectiveness by simply taking a vote, as you do with vaccines. You have to imagine the responses of subjects with a deep knowledge of art and enough clarity of mind to be able to ignore extraneous influences like the fame of the artist. And even then, you'd still see some disagreement. People do vary, and judging art is hard, especially recent art. There is definitely not a total order either of works or of people's ability to judge them. But there is equally definitely a partial order of both. So while it's not possible to have perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes Einstein from others besides his intelligence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you asked people what was special about Einstein, most would say that he was really smart. Even the ones who tried to give you a more sophisticated-sounding answer would probably think this first. Until a few years ago, I would have given the same answer myself. But that wasn't what was special about Einstein. What was special about him was that he had important new ideas. Being very smart was a necessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are not identical."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is more valuable: intelligence or the ability to discover new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I grew up thinking that being smart was the thing most to be desired. Perhaps you did too. But I bet it's not what you really want. Imagine you had a choice between being really smart but discovering nothing new, and being less smart but discovering lots of new ideas. Surely you'd take the latter. I would. The choice makes me uncomfortable, but when you see the two options laid out explicitly like that, it's obvious which is better."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why can the emphasis on intelligence during childhood create discomfort in valuing new ideas later in life?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason the choice makes me uncomfortable is that being smart still feels like the thing that matters, even though I know intellectually that it isn't. I spent so many years thinking it was. The circumstances of childhood are a perfect storm for fostering this illusion. Intelligence is much easier to measure than the value of new ideas, and you're constantly being judged by it. Whereas even the kids who will ultimately discover new things aren't usually discovering them yet. For kids that way inclined, intelligence is the only game in town."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does intelligence influence social dynamics in adulthood?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are more subtle reasons too, which persist long into adulthood. Intelligence wins in conversation and thus becomes the basis of the dominance hierarchy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between new ideas and society's understanding of intelligence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Having new ideas is such a new thing historically, and even now done by so few people, that society hasn't yet assimilated the fact that this is the actual destination, and intelligence is merely a means to an end."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the perception of intelligence differ from childhood beliefs according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The truth is excitingly different from the story I got as a kid. If intelligence is what matters, and also mostly inborn, the natural consequence is a sort of hierarchy among people based on their innate abilities, which contrasts with the childhood belief that intelligence can be developed equally in everyone."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between intelligence, aptitude, and personal control in shaping one's life and career?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fatalism suggests that the best you can do is figure out what sort of work you have an \"aptitude\" for, so that whatever intelligence you were born with will at least be put to the best use, and then work as hard as you can at it. However, if intelligence isn't what matters, but only one of several ingredients in what does, and many of those aren't inborn, things get more interesting. You have a lot more control, but the problem of how to arrange your life becomes that much more complicated."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does independent-mindedness relate to intelligence, and can it be developed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I wouldn't want to claim that this is distinct from intelligence â I'd be reluctant to call someone smart who wasn't independent-minded â but, though largely inborn, this quality seems to be something that can be cultivated to some extent."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors can enhance creativity and idea generation across different age groups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Getting enough sleep, avoiding certain kinds of stress, having the right colleagues, and finding tricks for working on what you want even when it's not what you're supposed to be working on are all factors that can enhance creativity and idea generation across different age groups. Anything that prevents people from doing great work has an inverse that helps them to. This class of ingredients is not as boring as it might seem at first. For example, having new ideas is generally associated with youth. But perhaps it's not youth per se that yields new ideas, but specific things that come with youth, like good health and lack of responsibilities. Investigating this might lead to strategies that will help people of any age to have better ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does writing ability influence the generation of new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most surprising ingredients in having new ideas is writing ability. There's a class of new ideas that are best discovered by writing essays and books. And that \"by\" is deliberate: you don't think of the ideas first and then merely write them down. There is a kind of thinking that one does by writing, and if you're clumsy at writing or don't enjoy doing it, that will get in your way if you try to do this kind of thinking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What insights can we gain by exploring the gap between intelligence and new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I predict the gap between intelligence and new ideas will turn out to be an interesting place. If we think of this gap merely as a measure of unrealized potential, it becomes a sort of wasteland that we try to hurry through with our eyes averted. But if we flip the question and start inquiring into the other ingredients in new ideas that it implies must exist, we can mine this gap for discoveries about discovery."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the different levels of effectiveness in conversation based on the participants involved?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The effectiveness of a conversation depends on the participants involved.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some other applications of intelligence beyond generating new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Just as intelligence isn't the only ingredient in having new ideas, having new ideas isn't the only thing intelligence is useful for. It's also useful, for example, in diagnosing problems and figuring out how to fix them. Both overlap with having new ideas, but both have an end that doesn't."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is more common than generating new ideas when it comes to the application of intelligence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Those ways of using intelligence are much more common than generating new ideas.

It started out as an essay about writing ability. But when I came to the distinction between intelligence and having new ideas, that seemed so much more important that I turned the original essay inside out, making that the topic and my original topic one of the points in it.

They may seem strange even to many Lisp programmers. Not only are they absent in many popular languages, but their nature makes them difficult to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of Lisp. Macros are evidence of techniques that go beyond simple glue programming. For example, they allow programmers to solve problems by first writing a language tailored for those types of problems and then writing specific applications within that language. This is just one area in a broader space of program-manipulating techniques that remains far from fully explored."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can learning unconventional programming languages enhance your understanding of programming concepts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To expand your concept of what programming can be, one way to do it is by learning unconventional languages. Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart, and then focus on the differences between this language and the intersection of popular languages. What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the process of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say, you'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn't previously think."}]}

He had great natural ability, but when his youth coaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent but his dedication and his desire to win. P. G.

There's a faint XOR between talent and hard work. This comes partly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, and partly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talent and great drive are both rare, then people with both are rare squared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have less of the other. But you'll need both if you want to be an outlier yourself. Since you can't really change how much natural talent you have, in practice, doing great work, insofar as you can, reduces to working very hard."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do work limits vary based on the type of task and individual circumstances?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The limit varies depending on the type of work and the person. I've done several different kinds of work, and the limits were different for each. My limit for the harder types of writing or programming is about five hours a day, whereas when I was running a startup, I could work all the time.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of recognizing one's own limits in the pursuit of quality work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate a sensitivity to the quality of the work you're doing, and then you'll notice if it decreases because you're working too hard. Honesty is critical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you're being lazy, but also when you're working too hard. And if you think there's something admirable about working too hard, get that idea out of your head.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should be the focus of one's efforts when determining the direction of their life and work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of these problems with a hard core. There are important problems at the center, which tend to be hard, and less important, easier ones at the edges. So, as well as the small, daily adjustments involved in working on a specific problem, you'll occasionally have to make big, lifetime-scale adjustments about which type of work to do.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How should one approach the difficulty of ambitious work when deciding what projects to undertake?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The more ambitious types of work will usually be harder, but although you should not be in denial about this, neither should you treat difficulty as an infallible guide in deciding what to do. If you discover some ambitious type of work that's a bargain in the sense of being easier for you than for other people, either because of the abilities you happen to have, or because of some new way you've found to approach it, or simply because you're more excited about it, by all means, work on that. Some of the best work is done by people who find an easy way to do something hard."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do personal interests influence the type of work one is suited for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure out which kind you're suited for.

What you're suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps even more on your interests."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it often more challenging to identify one's interests compared to talents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It can be harder to discover your interests than your talents. There are fewer types of talent than interests, and they start to be judged early in childhood, whereas interest in a topic is a subtle thing that may not mature until your twenties, or even later. The topic may not even exist earlier. Plus, there are some powerful sources of error you need to learn to discount.

That's one of the most important things I've learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the impression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is figure out what it is. That's how it works in movies and in the streamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way in real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and just do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly from one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identify one as their calling â we can wish Newton spent more time on math and physics and less on alchemy and theology â but this is an ongoing exploration for many individuals."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key factors that contribute to effective and productive hard work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It's a complicated, dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. You have to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kind you're best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you can, accurately judge at each moment both what you're capable of and how you're doing, and put in as many hours each day as you can without harming the quality of the result. This network is too complicated to trick. But if you're consistently honest and clear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, and you'll be productive in a way few people are."}]}

This made me as happy as anything I've heard him say â not just because he was excited about his story, but because he'd discovered this way of working.

I wouldn't say exactly that you're happier; a better word would be excited or engaged. You're happy when things are going well, but often they aren't. When I'm writing an essay, most of the time I'm worried and puzzled: worried that the essay will turn out badly, and puzzled because I'm groping for some idea that I can't see clearly enough.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do societal views on play and hobbies impact children's understanding of career paths?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many kids experience the excitement of working on projects of their own. The hard part is making this converge with the work you do as an adult. Our customs make it harder. We treat \"playing\" and \"hobbies\" as qualitatively different from \"work.\" It's not clear to a kid building a treehouse that there's a direct (though long) route from that to architecture or engineering. Instead of pointing out the route, we conceal it by implicitly treating the stuff kids do as different from real work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the traditional education system impact children's ability to engage in personal projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Instead of telling kids that their treehouses could be on the path to the work they do as adults, we tell them the path goes through school. Unfortunately, schoolwork tends to be very different from working on projects of one's own. It's usually neither a project nor one's own. So, as school gets more serious, working on projects of one's own is something that survives, if at all, as a thin thread off to the side."}]}

And not because I'm an indulgent parent, but because I've been on the other end, and I know which has more predictive value.

That's an interesting question, partly because the answer is so complicated, and partly because there's so much at stake. There turn out to be two senses in which work can be one's own: 1) that you're doing it voluntarily, rather than merely because someone told you to, and 2) that you're doing it by yourself."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors determine whether work feels like a choice or an obligation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The edge of the former is quite sharp. People who care a lot about their work are usually very sensitive to the difference between pulling and being pushed, and work tends to fall into one category or the other.

But for my father, who was a mathematician, it wasn't. Most of us think of the problems in a math book as a way to test or develop our knowledge of the material explained in each section. But to my father, the problems were the part that mattered, and the text was merely a sort of annotation. Whenever he got a new math book, it was to him like being given a puzzle: here was a new set of problems to solve, and he'd immediately set about solving all of them."}]}

One way to collaborate is to share a single project. For example, when two mathematicians collaborate on a proof that takes shape in the course of a conversation between them.

People like Burrell Smith, Andy Hertzfeld, Bill Atkinson, and Susan Kare were not just following orders. They were not tennis balls hit by Steve Jobs, but rockets let loose by Steve Jobs.

It's harder when they're not. And the hardest part, usually, is morale. That's where adults have it harder than kids. Kids just plunge in and build their treehouse without worrying about whether they're wasting their time or how it compares to other treehouses. Frankly, we could learn a lot from kids here.

While we may not have recognized as kids that our treehouses were stepping stones toward more complex endeavors, we can appreciate as adults that our current projects are connected to those early experiences.

Kids bounce, or are herded, from one kind of work to the next, barely realizing what's happening to them. Whereas we know more about different types of work and have more control over which we do. Ideally, we can have the best of both worlds: to be deliberate in choosing to work on projects of our own and carelessly confident in starting new ones."}]}

Its recent, narrower meaning raises the question of whether this change is for the better or worse.

The optimal organization would combine collaboration and ownership in such a way as to do the least damage to each. Interestingly, companies and university departments approach this ideal from opposite directions: companies insist on collaboration and occasionally also manage both to recruit skaters and allow them to skate, while university departments insist on the ability to do independent research (which is by custom treated as skating, whether it is or not), and the people they hire collaborate as much as they choose."}]}

In ordinary social situations, they are â as quiet and diffident as the star quarterback would be if he found himself in the middle of a physics symposium. And for the same reason: they are fish out of water. But the apparent diffidence of nerds is an illusion due to the fact that when non-nerds observe them, it's usually in ordinary social situations. In fact, some nerds are quite fierce."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics define the competitive nature of the fierce nerds compared to non-nerds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fierce nerds are a small but interesting group. They are, as a rule, extremely competitive â more competitive, I'd say, than highly competitive non-nerds. Competition is more personal for them, partly perhaps because they're not emotionally mature enough to distance themselves from it, but also because there's less randomness in the kinds of competition they engage in, and they are thus more justified in taking the results personally."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common characteristic of fierce nerds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another quality you find in most fierce nerds is intelligence. Not all nerds are smart, but the fierce ones are always at least moderately so. If they weren't, they wouldn't have the confidence to be fierce."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What traits characterize the communication style and problem-solving approach of fierce nerds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fierce nerds are characterized by impatience, which is evident in their communication style. They tend to interrupt others during conversations, which can be annoying. However, in the more promising fierce nerds, this impatience is connected to a deeper urgency about solving problems. Perhaps the competitiveness and impatience of fierce nerds are not separate qualities, but rather two manifestations of a single underlying drivenness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is being a fierce nerd advantageous in the business world compared to traditional scholarship?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, being a fierce nerd is probably even more helpful in business than in nerds' original territory of scholarship. Fierceness seems optional there; Darwin, for example, doesn't seem to have been especially fierce. Whereas it's impossible to be the CEO of a company over a certain size without being fierce, so now that nerds can win at business, fierce nerds will increasingly monopolize the really big successes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens to your fierceness if it is not properly exercised?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The bad news is that if it's not exercised, your fierceness will turn to bitterness, and you will become an intellectual playground bully: the grumpy sysadmin, the forum troll, the critic."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies can help prevent feelings of bitterness in life?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How do you avoid this fate? Work on ambitious projects. If you succeed, it will bring you a kind of satisfaction that neutralizes bitterness. But you don't need to have succeeded to feel this; merely working on hard projects gives most fierce nerds some feeling of satisfaction. And for those it doesn't, it at least keeps them busy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advice can be given to fierce nerds to balance their effectiveness with social interactions in a work environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The same qualities that make fierce nerds so effective can also make them very annoying. Fierce nerds would do well to remember this and (a) try to keep a lid on it, and (b) seek out organizations and types of work where getting the right answer matters more than preserving social harmony. In practice, that means small groups working on hard problems, which fortunately is the most fun kind of environment anyway."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some moderately successful individuals still experience bitterness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If success neutralizes bitterness, why are there some people who are at least moderately successful and yet still quite bitter? Because people's potential bitterness varies depending on how naturally bitter their personality is and how ambitious they are. Someone who's naturally very bitter will still have a lot left after success neutralizes some of it, and someone who's very ambitious will need proportionally more success to satisfy that ambition."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a situation in which someone might hesitate to openly disagree with a knowledgeable person's idea?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's one kind of opinion I'd be very afraid to express publicly.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the process through which revolutionary ideas often gain acceptance in society?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the history of science, knows that's how big things start. Someone proposes an idea that sounds crazy; most people dismiss it, then it gradually takes over the world."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why should we consider seemingly implausible ideas proposed by experts in their field?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most implausible-sounding ideas are, in fact, bad and could be safely dismissed. But not when they're proposed by reasonable domain experts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they know how implausible it sounds. And yet they're proposing it anyway. That suggests they know something you don't. And if they have deep domain expertise, that's probably the source of it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might implausible-sounding ideas from domain experts be more valuable than those from the average person?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Such ideas are not merely unsafe to dismiss, but disproportionately likely to be interesting. When the average person proposes an implausible-sounding idea, its implausibility is evidence of their incompetence. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, the situation is reversed. There's something like an efficient market here: on average, the ideas that seem craziest will, if correct, have the biggest effect. So if you can eliminate the theory that the person proposing an implausible-sounding idea is incompetent, its implausibility switches from evidence that it's boring to evidence that it's exciting."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the rationale behind investing in seemingly implausible ideas proposed by experts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Such ideas are not guaranteed to work, but they don't have to be. They just have to be sufficiently good bets â to have sufficiently high expected value. On average, I think they do. If you bet on the entire set of implausible-sounding ideas proposed by reasonable domain experts, you'd end up net ahead."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do new ideas often struggle to gain acceptance in current discussions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason is that everyone is too conservative. The word \"paradigm\" is overused, but this is a case where it's warranted. Everyone is too much in the grip of the current paradigm. Even the people who have the new ideas undervalue them initially, which means that before they reach the stage of proposing them publicly, they've already subjected them to an excessively strict filter."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should be the approach when encountering a differing opinion from a knowledgeable individual?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The wise response to such an idea is not to make statements but to ask questions, because there's a real mystery here. Why has this smart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong? Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be. If you're the one who's mistaken, that would be good to know, because it means there's a hole in your model of the world. But even if they're mistaken, it should be interesting to learn why. A trap that an expert falls into is one you have to worry about too."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates some people to oppose or criticize radical new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason some people oppose or criticize radical new ideas is envy. If you propose a radical new idea and it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth) will increase proportionally. Some people would be envious if that happened, and this potential envy propagates back into a conviction that you must be wrong."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some people tend to reject new ideas in favor of established beliefs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it's an easy way to seem sophisticated. When a new idea first emerges, it usually seems pretty feeble; it's a mere hatchling. Received wisdom is a full-grown eagle by comparison. So, it's easy to launch a devastating attack on a new idea, and anyone who does will seem clever to those who don't understand this asymmetry."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the rewards differ for those innovating new ideas compared to those critiquing them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This phenomenon is exacerbated by the difference between how those working on new ideas and those critiquing them are rewarded. The rewards for working on new ideas are weighted by the value of the outcome. So, it's worth working on something that only has a 10% chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10 times better. Whereas the rewards for critiquing new ideas are roughly constant; such critiques seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do individuals often resist new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest in the old ones. It's not surprising, for example, that some of Darwin's harshest critics were churchmen. People build whole careers on certain ideas. When someone claims they're false or obsolete, they feel threatened."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the lowest form of dismissing an idea in a debate or discussion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The lowest form of dismissal is mere factionalism: to automatically dismiss any idea associated with the opposing faction. The lowest form of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the difficulty of proposing and accepting new ideas within an established paradigm?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main factor that leads reasonable people to dismiss new ideas is the same thing that holds people back from proposing them: the sheer pervasiveness of the current paradigm. It doesn't just affect the way we think; it is the Lego blocks we build thoughts out of. Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people can do. Even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at first, like a pilot flying through clouds who has to trust his instruments over his sense of balance."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do established paradigms influence the acceptance of new scientific ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Paradigms don't just define our present thinking. They also vacuum up the trail of crumbs that led to them, making our standards for new ideas impossibly high. The current paradigm seems so perfect to us, its offspring, that we imagine it must have been accepted completely as soon as it was discovered â that whatever the church thought of the heliocentric model, astronomers must have been convinced as soon as Copernicus proposed it. Far, in fact, from it. Copernicus published the heliocentric model in 1532, but it wasn't until the mid-seventeenth century that the balance of scientific opinion shifted in its favor."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an effective way to cultivate new ideas according to the challenges they face in their early stages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Few understand how feeble new ideas look when they first appear. So, if you want to have new ideas yourself, one of the most valuable things you can do is to learn what they look like when they're born. Read about how new ideas happened, and try to get yourself into the heads of people at the time. How did things look to them when the new idea was only half-finished, and even the person who had it was only half-convinced it was right?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to support individuals with new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're nice, as well as wise, you won't merely resist attacking such people but encourage them.

When they find a suspect, they want to believe he's guilty and ignore or even destroy evidence suggesting otherwise. District attorneys want to be seen as effective and tough on crime, and in order to win convictions, they are willing to manipulate witnesses and withhold evidence. Court-appointed defense attorneys are overworked and often incompetent. There's a ready supply of criminals willing to give false testimony in return for a lighter sentence, suggestible witnesses who can be made to say whatever police want, and bogus \"experts\" eager to claim that science proves the defendant is guilty.

Not because inheritance taxes increased. In fact, they decreased significantly during this period. The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is not that fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more people are making them."}]}

Roughly 3/4 by starting companies and 1/4 by investing.

However, if your model of normal is the mid-20th century, you have a very misleading perspective in that respect. J.P.

Partly, there was senescence; the big companies that had seemed models of scale and efficiency in 1930 had, by 1970, become slack and bloated. By that time, the rigid structure of the economy was full of cozy nests that various groups had built to insulate themselves from market forces. During the Carter administration, the federal government realized something was amiss and began, in a process they called \"deregulation,\" to roll back the policies that propped up the oligopolies."}]}

If you only look back as far as the mid-20th century, it seems like people getting rich by starting their own companies is a recent phenomenon. However, if you look back further, you realize it's actually the default. Therefore, what we should expect in the future is more of the same. Indeed, we should expect both the number and wealth of founders to grow, because every decade it gets easier to start a startup."}]}

Society is (re)assimilating the concept. If you start one now, your parents won't freak out the way they would have a generation ago, and knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread. But the main reason it's easier to start a startup now is that it's cheaper. Technology has driven down the cost of both building products and acquiring customers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the decreasing cost of starting a startup affected the relationship between founders and investors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The decreasing cost of starting a startup has, in turn, changed the balance of power between founders and investors. Back when starting a startup meant building a factory, you needed investors' permission to do it at all.

That means more people start them, that those who do get better terms from investors, and that the resulting companies become more valuable. Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and that startups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don't have to resort to some vague right turn the country took under Reagan to explain why America's Gini coefficient is increasing.

However, the vast majority of these companies are small retail and service businesses. Therefore, what the statistics about the decreasing number of new businesses mean is that people are starting fewer shoe stores and barber shops."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does a declining graph labeled \"startups\" indicate about the definition of startups being referenced?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When they see a graph labeled \"startups\" that's going down, it is important to understand that there are two senses of the word \"startup\": (1) the founding of a company, and (2) a particular type of company designed to grow big fast. The statistics refer to startups in sense (1), not sense (2)."}]}

Starting one's own company is risky, and when risk isn't rewarded, people opt for safer employment options instead."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the economic conditions of the mid 20th century influence tax policies and entrepreneurship?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The economic conditions of the mid-20th century influenced tax policies and entrepreneurship in a complex manner. The oligopolies and high tax rates of that era were interconnected. Lower taxes are not just a cause of entrepreneurship but an effect as well: the people getting rich in the mid-20th century from real estate and oil exploration lobbied for and obtained huge tax loopholes that made their effective tax rates much lower. Presumably, if it had been more common to grow large companies by building new technology, the individuals involved in that would have lobbied for their own loopholes as well."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the main industries that contributed to wealth accumulation in the mid 20th century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The people who got rich in the mid-20th century often did so through oil exploration or real estate. These were the two major areas of the economy that weren't susceptible to consolidation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of higher valuations for startups in terms of stock and fundraising?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Higher valuations mean you either sell less stock to get a given amount of money or get more money for a given amount of stock. The typical startup does some of each. Obviously, you end up richer if you keep more stock, but you should also end up richer if you raise more money because (a) it should make the company more successful and (b) you should be able to last longer before the next round or not even need one. Notice all those \"shoulds,\" though. In practice, a lot of money slips through them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some startups raise large amounts of funding despite the notion that starting a business has become cheaper?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It might seem that the huge rounds raised by startups nowadays contradict the claim that it has become cheaper to start one. But there's no contradiction here; the startups that raise the most are the ones doing it by choice in order to grow faster, not the ones doing it because they need the money to survive. There's nothing like not needing money to make people offer it to you."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the readability of writing impact reader engagement with ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Writing that is easier to read allows readers to engage more deeply with the content.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to prioritize simplicity in writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Itâs more considerate to write simply. When you write in a fancy way to impress people, you're making them do extra work just so you can seem cool. It's like trailing a long train behind you that readers have to carry."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How should you approach writing on complex topics for a diverse audience with varying levels of English proficiency?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When writing in English, remember that many of your readers may not be native English speakers. Their understanding of ideas may be far ahead of their understanding of English. Therefore, you cannot assume that writing about a difficult topic allows you to use difficult words."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is simple writing considered to have greater longevity and accessibility for future readers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Simple writing also lasts better. People reading your work in the future will be in much the same position as people from other countries reading it today. The culture and the language will have changed. It's not vain to care about that, any more than it's vain for a woodworker to build a chair to last."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates the author to prioritize simplicity in their writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But although these are all real advantages of writing simply, none of them are why I do it. The main reason I write simply is that it offends me not to. When I write a sentence that seems too complicated or that uses unnecessarily intellectual words, it doesn't seem fancy to me. It seems clumsy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's approach to writing that contributes to the simplicity of their work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other reason my writing ends up being simple is the way I do it. I write the first draft fast, then spend days editing it, trying to get everything just right. Much of this editing involves cutting, and that makes simple writing even simpler."}]}

If you haven't been involved with nonprofits, you may never have heard this phrase before. But if you have been, it probably made you wince."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are restricted donations often considered detrimental to nonprofits?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Restricted donations refer to contributions where the donor limits how the funds can be used. This is common with large donations and is often the default arrangement. However, it is usually a bad idea. Typically, the way the donor wants the money spent is not aligned with how the nonprofit would have chosen to allocate those funds. If it were, there would be no need to restrict the donation. Ultimately, who has a better understanding of where the money needs to be spent: the nonprofit or the donor?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the exceptions to the principle of making unrestricted donations to nonprofits?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are a couple of exceptions to this principle. One is when the nonprofit is an umbrella organization. It's reasonable to make a restricted donation to a university, for example, because a university is only nominally a single nonprofit. Another exception is when the donor actually does know as much as the nonprofit about where money needs to be spent. The Gates Foundation, for example, has specific goals and often makes restricted donations to individual nonprofits to accomplish them. But unless you're a domain expert yourself or donating to an umbrella organization, your donation would do more good if it were unrestricted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates donors to make restricted donations despite their lesser impact compared to unrestricted ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If restricted donations do less good than unrestricted ones, why do donors so often make them? Partly because doing good isn't the donors' only motive. They often have other motives as well â to make a mark or to generate good publicity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to donors' misunderstanding of restricted versus unrestricted donations in the nonprofit sector?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many donors may simply never have considered the distinction between restricted and unrestricted donations. They may believe that donating money for some specific purpose is just how donations work. To be fair, nonprofits don't try very hard to discourage such illusions; they can't afford to. People running nonprofits are almost always anxious about money and can't afford to talk back to big donors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of donations do nonprofits prefer and why?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can't expect candor in a relationship so asymmetric. So I'll tell you what nonprofits wish they could tell you: If you want to donate to a nonprofit, donate unrestricted. If you trust them to spend your money, trust them to decide how."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do restricted donations often receive more publicity than unrestricted donations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Unfortunately, restricted donations tend to generate more publicity than unrestricted ones. \"X donates money to build a school in Africa\" is not only more interesting than \"X donates money to Y nonprofit to spend as Y chooses,\" but also focuses more attention on X."}]}

I didn't write essays; I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What early programming experience did the author have in junior high school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines â CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader â sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What programming language and method were commonly used in early computing before modern interfaces?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did the author face while trying to program on the 1401?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. In retrospect, there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculating approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was your experience with programming and computer usage when you first acquired a TRS-80?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Computers were expensive in those days, and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about two pages of text, so he'd write two pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter."}]}

In college, I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored."}]}

This meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was okay. For the next couple of years, I was on a roll.

I could take whatever classes I liked and choose whatever I wanted to put on my degree. I, of course, chose \"Artificial Intelligence.\" When I received the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare quotes. At the time, this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover."}]}

Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the author have about AI during their first year of grad school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school, I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What limitations were identified in early natural language processing programs like SHRDLU?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Early natural language processing programs like SHRDLU demonstrated that there is a subset of natural language that functions as a formal language, but it is a very limited subset. It became clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what these programs could achieve and actual understanding of natural language. It was not simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. The approach of using explicit data structures to represent concepts was fundamentally flawed. Its limitations did, as often happens, generate numerous opportunities to write papers about various temporary fixes, but it was never going to lead to true understanding."}]}

I had plenty of respect for theory â indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves â but building things seemed so much more exciting."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of creating software systems in terms of their longevity and relevance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The problem with systems work, though, is that it doesn't last. Any program you write today, no matter how good, will be obsolete in a couple of decades at best. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it. Indeed, it would seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good."}]}

One day, I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there, I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old."}]}

This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages.

In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain, \"that's a water droplet,\" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or \"that's a bush,\" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life, it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do, there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can."}]}

For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature style, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work."}]}

They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going because painting was what they did.

One day in late 1994, as I was stretching one of these monsters, there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't that much older than me and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work on whatever I want."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact did the author believe the World Wide Web would have on the internet's popularity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Meanwhile, I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did the author face when trying to start an online art gallery business?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy ones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate websites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an HTTP server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the author have about internet storefronts in relation to their existing website-building experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that, except for the order buttons, they were identical to the sites we'd been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did the authors face when developing software for online stores, and what platforms did they initially choose to use?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first, this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores â in Lisp, of course."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What innovative idea did the author have while staying in Robert's apartment that could change how users interact with software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason, there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning, as I was lying on this mattress, I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve them from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was a significant breakthrough achieved in developing browser-based software for store building?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time, it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple of days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What innovative approach to software development was envisioned that could eliminate the need for multiple versions and complex release processes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't need versions or ports or any of that crap. At Interleaf, there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What inspired the founders of Viaweb to create a funding model that would later influence Y Combinator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle's husband, Julian. In return for that and for doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later, this deal became the model for Y Combinator's. We knew founders needed something like this because we'd needed it ourselves."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the author's negative net worth at that time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At this stage, I had a negative net worth because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes. Had I diligently set aside the proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf? No, I had not. So although Robert had his graduate student stipend, I needed that seed funding to live on."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can an online store builder enhance the credibility of small business owners?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Studying art has been beneficial because the main goal of an online store builder is to make users look legitimate, and the key to looking legitimate is high production values. If you get page layouts, fonts, and colors right, you can make a person running a store out of his bedroom look more legitimate than a big company."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why does the author describe their website as looking old-fashioned?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because it's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but in 1996, it was the last word in slick."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What led to the decision to recruit more programmers for the project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a month,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in retrospect because he would still be working on it almost three years later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers, and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good. He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first because at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with him. But Robert was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did the business face when launching its ecommerce stores in 1996?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We opened for business, with six stores, in January 1996. It was just as well we waited a few months because, although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually wanted online stores."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the main components of the software developed, and who was responsible for each part?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote; the shopping cart, which Robert wrote; and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do was work on this software, the next three years would have been the easiest of my life. Unfortunately, I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next three years were instead the most stressful."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What pricing strategy did the founders of Viaweb adopt for their ecommerce software, and what influenced this decision?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf, which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things; $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What insights did you gain about effective retail imagery during your experience with shirt photographs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For example, if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a close-up of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt. The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans was so beautiful too."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key factors that determine the long-term success of a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The ultimate test of a startup is its growth rate. Our growth rate was fine; we had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. While that is important in the sense that it affects how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough, you might go out of business, in the long term, the growth rate takes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't hire too many more people, and you'll soon be profitable, and then you'll control your own destiny."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did the company face due to its hiring practices and investor pressures during the Internet Bubble?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that's what startups did during the Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would have seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. This, in turn, meant we were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company. Since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the acquisition by Yahoo impact the author's perception of wealth and lifestyle?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle, our Viaweb stock was valuable; it was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had no idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started. So when Yahoo bought us, it felt like going from rags to riches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were by far the most luxurious thing I owned."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the author's decreased productivity between 1998 and 1999?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. For a while after I got to California, I tried to continue my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue combined with Yahoo's prematurely aged."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated the author to leave Yahoo and return to painting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the time, I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth anything, but to my astonishment, the stock went up 5x in the next year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999, I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been entirely full of software and men's shirts for four years. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What concerns did the authorâs boss have about their decision to leave Yahoo during the Internet Bubble?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time, I was touched that he took such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was ground zero of it. My boss was, at that moment, a billionaire. Leaving then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely, and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advice does the author give to founders who have just sold their companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately. There was no time to lose. I'd already burned four years getting rich. Now, when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's what I should have doneâjust gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the author's lack of motivation to paint in California?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people in California. I had compounded this problem by buying a house up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months; then, in desperation, I went back to New York, where, unless you understand about rent control, you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed up like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and there were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't know any of them."}]}

It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now, when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now, when I walked past charming little restaurants, I could go in and order lunch. It was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented with a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet)."}]}

It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink. So, while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly refused to work on it."}]}

This name didn't last long before it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it; it was going to be called Aspra."}]}

But about halfway through the summer, I realized I really didn't want to run a company â especially not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd only started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be realized as a company, then screw the vision.

A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer, Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge."}]}

Afterward, I put a postscript file of this talk online on paulgraham.com, which I had created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day, it got 30,000 page views.

I thought, \"Wow, there's an audience.\" If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then. In the print era, there was a narrow channel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book or in a newspaper or magazine. Now, anyone could publish anything."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the accessibility of publishing changed the landscape for essay writers compared to the print era?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.

Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish on my website. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it indicate when someone is attracted to work that lacks prestige?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to be discovered there and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people. So while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee you're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the most common type of wrong one."}]}

That first batch included Reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch; Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access; and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What terms were offered to startups in the investment deal, and how did they compare to previous deals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus, that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does funding startups in batches benefit both investors and founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fairly quickly, I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: isolation. Now, they not only had colleagues but also colleagues who understood the problems they were facing and could tell them how they were solving them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What benefits have emerged from the growth of the Y Combinator community for its startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's customers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC grows, this becomes less and less of a joke. Now, lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the founder's initial plans for their time change as Y Combinator grew?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I had not originally intended for YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years, I was still able to work on other things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What inspired the creation and rebranding of Hacker News?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months, I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus, it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach; it was future startup founders. So, I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's intellectual curiosity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the primary source of stress for the author while working at YC?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had to do with everything else combined."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What led to the reduction of the author's projects from three to two?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What makes working at Y Combinator a unique experience compared to other jobs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every six months, there was a new batch of startups, and their problems, whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have picked a better way to do it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated the speaker to work hard despite disliking certain aspects of their job?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There were parts of the job I didn't like: disputes between cofounders, figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who maltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the parts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once said about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second part that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better work very hard."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What important advice did Robert Morris give about career opportunities during a visit in 2010?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews, Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited advice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I remember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you should make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the speaker come to regarding their commitment to YC and its impact on other projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At the time, I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it dawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange advice because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be the last thing I did because it was only taking up more of my attention. It had already eaten Arc and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work, or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would."}]}

The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them, I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the rationale behind the decision to recruit Sam Altman as president of YC?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor, and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up until that point, YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that, it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the circumstances that led to Sam becoming the president of Y Combinator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013, he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013, I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When did you stop actively working with Y Combinator, and how do you stay connected with the startup community?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I kept working with Y Combinator until March to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day. After that, I checked out pretty completely. I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What new activity did the author choose to pursue after leaving YC?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So, the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty, and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did the artist face that led to a pause in their painting practice?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up until that point, I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the original purpose of Lisp as conceived by John McCarthy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense; it was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the significance of Steve Russell's contribution to the development of Lisp as a programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "McCarthy didn't realize that Lisp could even be used to program computers until his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point, Lisp started to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. However, its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What limitations did McCarthy face when developing his 1960 Lisp interpreter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. However, it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way â indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated the author to undertake a four-year project based on McCarthy's axiomatic approach to programming languages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took four years, from March 26, 2015, to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did the author face in creating an interpreter for Arc?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In itself, Arc may sound like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious collection of hacks, I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast, but fast enough to test."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did the author face while working on their interpreter project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I'd never have finished. In late 2015, I spent three months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel, I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written, but because the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an interpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What experiences did you have while working on Bel that made you feel fulfilled?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated your family to move to England, and how long did you initially plan to stay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the summer of 2016, we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live here. So most of Bel was written in England."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What inspired the author to write a detailed essay about their decision-making process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was your experience in the evolution of computer technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive operating systems.

In the 1990s, the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e., Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did the online store builder need to launch privately before going public?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most software can be launched as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly, we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores."}]}

However, this wasn't an app editor because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them."}]}

How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they may not want to hear, which can provoke strong reactions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the distinction between putting something on the internet and publishing it online?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s, of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do outdated customs in venture capital impact startups in the current landscape?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What traits might provide an advantage in rapidly changing fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People who are independent-minded (i.e., less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change, where customs are more likely to be obsolete."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some unexpected fields that may experience rapid change due to technological advancements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously, software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the original name of Y Combinator and why was it changed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Y Combinator was not the original name. At first, we were called Cambridge Seed. However, we didn't want a regional name in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did the author choose orange as the color for their logo?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005, all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did YC transition from a self-funded model to becoming a fund in 2009?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "YC transitioned to a fund for a couple of years starting in 2009 because it was getting so big that I could no longer afford to fund it personally. However, after Heroku was bought, we had enough money to return to being self-funded."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the concept of \"deal flow\" in relation to startup creation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've never liked the term \"deal flow\" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed."}]}

However, they were all heavier than she could carry now."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges arise from simultaneously writing essays and managing a forum?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another problem with HN is a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum, you're assumed to see, if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually, these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations because the assumption that you're present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that, in turn, encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses that now is their chance."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the most challenging aspect of leaving Y Combinator for the author?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica anymore. We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known each other, and we had neither tried nor wanted to separate it from our personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted tree."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities do Jessica and the speaker value most in startup founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jessica and I have certain words that have special significance when we're talking about startups. The highest compliment we can pay to founders is to describe them as \"earnest.\" This is not, by itself, a guarantee of success. You could be earnest but incapable. But when founders are both formidable (another of our words) and earnest, they're as close to unstoppable as you get."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is earnestness considered important in modern contexts like Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Earnestness sounds like a boring, even Victorian virtue. It seems a bit of an anachronism that people in Silicon Valley would care about it. However, this quality matters significantly in modern contexts because it fosters authenticity, trust, and meaningful connections in a fast-paced, often superficial environment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean to describe someone as earnest?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you call someone earnest, you're making a statement about their motives. It means both that they're doing something for the right reasons and that they're trying as hard as they can. If we imagine motives as vectors, it means both the direction and the magnitude are right. Though these are, of course, related: when people are doing something for the right reasons, they try harder."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are motives important for entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason motives matter so much in Silicon Valley is that so many people there have the wrong ones. Starting a successful startup makes you rich and famous, so a lot of the people trying to start them are doing it for those reasons instead of for an interest in the problem for its own sake. That is the root of earnestness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean to identify as a \"nerd\" in relation to personal interests?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Identifying as a \"nerd\" means that individuals are deeply interested in a particular subject for its own sake, rather than because it is considered cool or because of any potential benefits they might gain from it. When people describe themselves as \"x nerds,\" they are expressing that they care so much about x that they are willing to sacrifice appearing cool for the sake of their passion."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities do Jessica and the speaker value in founders, and what challenges do these qualities present?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jessica and I look for certain qualities in founders. While caring can be a source of strength, it also presents vulnerabilities. Caring constrains you; the earnest can't easily respond in kind to mocking banter or put on a cool facade of nihil admirari. They care too much and are often doomed to be the straight man. That's a real disadvantage in your endeavors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities contribute to the success of former nerds in the workplace compared to their high school peers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's commonplace now that the kids who were nerds in high school become the cool kids' bosses later on. However, people misunderstand why this happens. It's not just because the nerds are smarter, but also because they're more earnest. When the problems get harder than the fake ones you're given in high school, caring about them starts to matter."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "In what contexts might earnestness not lead to success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Does it always matter? Do the earnest always win? Not always. It probably doesn't matter much in politics, or in crime, or in certain types of business that are similar to crime, like gambling, personal injury law, patent trolling, and so on. Nor does it matter in academic fields at the more advanced levels."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can cynicism coexist with humor, and if so, how does it affect the perception of funniness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cynicism can coexist with humor, and it may not matter in some kinds of humor; it is possible to be completely cynical and still be very funny."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How are earnest individuals perceived in relation to their understanding of others' motives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Along with \"nerd,\" another word that tends to be associated with earnestness is \"naive.\" The earnest often seem naive. It's not just that they don't have the motives other people have; they often don't fully grasp that such motives exist. Or they may know intellectually that they do, but because they don't feel them, they forget about them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can a naive perspective positively influence problem-solving and creativity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It works to be slightly naive not just about motives but also, believe it or not, about the problems you're working on. Naive optimism can compensate for the bit rot that occurs in our thinking, allowing for fresh perspectives and innovative solutions. This mindset encourages individuals to explore unconventional ideas and challenge established norms, ultimately enhancing creativity and problem-solving capabilities."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What can happen when you approach a problem with the assumption that it is simple?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Approaching a problem with the assumption that it is simple can lead to misunderstandings and misjudgments.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do we often overlook the intellectual significance of business in society?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The question really is why we have a blind spot about business. The answer to that is obvious if you know enough history. For most of history, making large amounts of money has not been very intellectually interesting. In preindustrial times, it was never far from robbery, and some areas of business still retain that character, except using lawyers instead of soldiers."}]}

To convince Y Combinator to fund you, it's essential to demonstrate these qualities."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary quality that Y Combinator seeks in startup founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What Y Combinator looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group of users and can make what they want.

In a market economy, it's hard to make something people want that they don't already have. That's the great thing about market economies. If other people both knew about this need and were able to satisfy it, they already would be, and there would be no room for your startup."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria do YC partners use to evaluate startup founders and their ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The YC partners evaluate startup founders and their ideas by assessing whether the founders have discovered a real need and whether they will be able to satisfy it. In this part of their job, they act as professional guessers. They have numerous heuristics for doing this, and while I won't disclose all of them, I can share the most important ones, as these cannot be faked; the only way to \"hack\" them would be to do what you should be doing anyway as a founder."}]}

It doesn't have to be something a lot of people want now. The product and the market will both evolve and will influence each other's evolution. But in the end, there has to be something with a huge market. That's what the partners will be trying to figure out: is there a path to a huge market?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common motivation drives the founders of successful startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the sense of being at the leading edge of some kind of change, founders of successful startups are often building something they themselves want. Most super-successful startups are of this type. Steve Wozniak wanted a computer. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to engage online with his college friends. Larry and Sergey wanted to find things on the web. All these founders were building things they and their peers wanted, and the fact that they were at the leading edge of change meant that more people would want these things in the future."}]}

That may seem like an obvious point, but the lack of it is the biggest flaw in most startup ideas. There have to be some people who want what you're building right now and want it so urgently that they're willing to use it, bugs and all, even though you're a small company they've never heard of. There don't have to be many, but there have to be some. As long as you have some users, there are straightforward ways to get more: build new features they want, seek out more people like them, get them to refer you to their friends, and so on.

The founders of Airbnb demonstrated this quality well; they were able to tell us all about what motivated hosts and guests. They knew from firsthand experience because they had been the first hosts. We couldn't ask them a question they didn't know the answer to. We ourselves were not very excited about the idea as users, but we knew this didn't prove anything, because there were lots of successful startups we hadn't been excited about as users. We were able to say to ourselves, \"They seem to know what they're talking about. Maybe they're onto something.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do YC partners assess the market potential of ideas presented by founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "YC partners assess the market potential of ideas presented by founders by relying on the founders themselves to provide insights about the market. While traditional VCs often consult domain experts to evaluate potential markets, YC partners do not have the time for this process. Instead, they focus on ensuring that the founders both (a) know what they are talking about and (b) are being truthful. If the YC partners can convince themselves of these two points, they can use the founders as their domain experts when evaluating the idea."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are YC interviews structured as short, question-and-answer sessions rather than traditional pitches?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is why YC interviews aren't pitches. To give as many founders as possible a chance to get funded, we made interviews as short as we could: 10 minutes. That is not enough time for the partners to figure out, through the indirect evidence in a pitch, whether you know what you're talking about and aren't lying. They need to dig in and ask you questions. There's not enough time for sequential access; they need random access."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common mistake candidates make during a YC interview that can hinder their success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The worst advice I ever heard about how to succeed in a YC interview is that you should take control of the interview and make sure to deliver the message you want to. In other words, turn the interview into a pitch. It is so annoying when people try to do that. You ask them a question, and instead of answering it, they deliver some obviously prefabricated blob of pitch. It eats up 10 minutes really fast."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who can provide the best guidance for succeeding in a Y Combinator interview?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is no one who can give you accurate advice about what to do in a YC interview except a current or former YC partner. People who've merely been interviewed, even successfully, have no idea of this, but interviews take all sorts of different forms depending on what the partners want to know about most. Sometimes they're all about the founders; other times they're all about the idea. Sometimes, it's about some very narrow aspect of the idea. Founders sometimes walk away from interviews complaining that they didn't get to explain their idea completely. True, but they explained enough."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies should candidates use to effectively answer questions during a YC interview?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since a YC interview consists of questions, the way to do it well is to answer them well. Part of that is answering them candidly. The partners don't expect you to know everything. But if you don't know the answer to a question, don't try to bullshit your way out of it. The partners, like most experienced investors, are professional bullshit detectors, and you are (hopefully) an amateur bullshitter. If you try to bullshit them and fail, they may not even tell you that you failed. So it's better to be honest than to try to sell them. If you don't know the answer to a question, say you don't, and tell them how you'd go about finding it, or tell them the answer to some related question."}]}

Far better to go into gruesome detail. That's what experts do when you ask what could go wrong. The partners know that your idea is risky. That's what a good bet looks like at this stage: a tiny probability of a huge outcome."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors do Y Combinator partners consider more critical than competition when assessing a startup's potential for success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Competitors are rarely what kills startups; poor execution does. However, you should know who your competitors are and tell the YC partners candidly what your relative strengths and weaknesses are. Because the YC partners know that competitors don't kill startups, they won't hold competitors against you too much. They will, however, hold it against you if you seem either to be unaware of competitors or to be minimizing the threat they pose. They may not be sure whether you're clueless or lying, but they don't need to be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do seed investors prioritize over a flawless idea in a pitch?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The partners don't expect your idea to be perfect.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence the likelihood of founders successfully navigating a path to a big market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If the partners are sufficiently convinced that there's a path to a big market, the next question is whether you'll be able to find it. That, in turn, depends on three things: the general qualities of the founders, their specific expertise in this domain, and the relationship between them. How determined are the founders? Are they good at building things? Are they resilient enough to keep going when things go wrong? How strong is their friendship?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unique experience led to the decision to fund the Airbnb founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Though the Airbnbs only did okay in the idea department, they did spectacularly well in this department. The story of how they funded themselves by making Obama- and McCain-themed breakfast cereal was the single most important factor in our decision to fund them. They didn't realize it at the time, but what seemed to them an irrelevant story was, in fact, fabulously good evidence of their qualities as founders. It showed they were resourceful and determined, and could work together."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated the founders to dedicate themselves to their startup beyond financial incentives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It wasn't just the cereal story that showed that, though.

The reason they were working so hard on this company was that it was their project. They had discovered an interesting new idea, and they just couldn't let it go."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates billionaires who start their own companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What really drives billionaires, or at least the ones who become billionaires from starting companies, is their passion for what they're building.

They could have gotten acquired or found someone else to run the company; many founders do. The ones who become really rich are the ones who keep working. What makes them keep working is not just money. What keeps them working is the same thing that keeps anyone else working when they could stop if they wanted to: that there's nothing else they'd rather do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities do Y Combinator look for in startup founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Y Combinator looks for authenticity in startup founders. This quality is defined by a genuine interest in the problem they are addressing, rather than merely exploiting people for profit. Founders' motives for starting startups are usually mixed, often stemming from a combination of the desire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuine interest in the problem, and an unwillingness to work for someone else. The last two motivationsâgenuine interest in the problem and a desire for independenceâare generally more powerful than the first two. While it is acceptable for founders to want to make money or to appear impressive, they must demonstrate that their primary drive is rooted in authenticity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Y Combinator evaluate the integrity of founders during the selection process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Y Combinator certainly sees founders whose modus operandi is to exploit people. YC is a magnet for them because they want the YC brand. However, when the YC partners detect someone like that, they reject them. If bad people made good founders, the YC partners would face a moral dilemma. Fortunately, they don't, because bad people make bad founders. This exploitative type of founder is not going to succeed on a large scale and, in fact, probably won't even succeed on a small one because they're always going to be taking shortcuts. They see YC itself as a shortcut."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the consequences of a founder exploiting their cofounders and initial users in a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exploitation usually begins with the founder's own cofounders, which is disastrous since the cofounders' relationship is the foundation of the company. Then it moves on to the users, which is also disastrous because the early adopters that a successful startup wants as its initial users are the hardest to fool. The best this kind of founder can hope for is to keep the edifice of deception tottering along until some acquirer can be tricked into buying it. However, that kind of acquisition is never very big."}]}

It makes me feel bad too, and I think people who make a lot of money have a moral obligation to use it for the common good. The mistake they make is to jump from feeling bad that some people are much richer than others to the conclusion that there's no legitimate way to make a very large amount of money. Now we're getting into statements that are not only falsifiable but false."}]}

Stop delighting users, and eventually, someone else will."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What key focus should founders have when discussing their businesses with investors and during interviews?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Users are what the partners want to know about in YC interviews, and what I want to know about when I talk to founders that we funded ten years ago and who are billionaires now.

The partners don't try to seem skeptical, as buyers in transactions often do to increase their leverage. Although the founders feel their job is to convince the partners of the potential of their idea, these roles are not infrequently reversed, and the founders leave the interview feeling their idea has more potential than they realized."}]}

They did nothing halfway, and we could sense this even in the interview. Sometimes after we interviewed a startup, we'd be uncertain what to do and have to talk it over. Other times, we'd just look at one another and smile. The Airbnbs' interview was that kind. We didn't even like the idea that much. Nor did users at that stage; they had no growth.

But something surprising happened: they enjoyed having those first three guests staying with them. And the guests enjoyed it too. Both they and the guests had done it because they were, in a sense, forced to, and yet they'd all had a great experience.

Ramen profitability is not, obviously, the end goal of any startup, but it's the most important threshold on the way because this is the point where you're airborne. This is the point where you no longer need investors' permission to continue existing. For the Airbnbs, ramen profitability was $4,000 a month: $3,500 for rent and $500 for food.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities should a startup idea have to stand out in a competitive market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You see this pattern with startup founders too. You don't want to start a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea, or there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do something that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but that you know isn't â like writing software for a tiny computer used by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let people rent airbeds on strangers' floors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does one's natural mindset influence their job satisfaction and suitability for different roles?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Independent-mindedness seems to be more a matter of nature than nurture, which means if you pick the wrong type of work, you're going to be unhappy. If you're naturally independent-minded, you're going to find it frustrating to be a middle manager. Conversely, if you're naturally conventional-minded, you're going to be sailing into a headwind if you try to do original research."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do individuals face in accurately perceiving their own mindset on the spectrum from conventional to independent thinking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One difficulty here, though, is that people are often mistaken about where they fall on the spectrum from conventional to independent-minded. Conventional-minded people don't like to think of themselves as conventional-minded. In any case, it genuinely feels to them as if they make up their own minds about everything. It's just a coincidence that their beliefs are identical to their peers'. Meanwhile, the independent-minded are often unaware of how different their ideas are from conventional ones, at least until they state them publicly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the education system impact the recognition of independent-mindedness in individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By the time they reach adulthood, most people know roughly how smart they are (in the narrow sense of ability to solve pre-set problems) because they're constantly being tested and ranked according to it. However, schools generally ignore independent-mindedness, except to the extent they try to suppress it. As a result, we don't receive anything like the same kind of feedback about how independent-minded we are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the Dunning-Kruger effect relate to perceptions of independent-mindedness among individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There may even be a phenomenon like the Dunning-Kruger effect at work, where the most conventional-minded people are confident that they're independent-minded, while the genuinely independent-minded worry they might not be independent-minded enough."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What technique can help individuals avoid conforming to societal norms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally by most nerds: simply to be less aware of what conventional beliefs are. It's hard to be a conformist if you don't know what you're supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people already are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would probably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought and make more effort to find out."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the mindset of the people you associate with influence your own creativity and idea generation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you're surrounded by conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you can express, and that, in turn, will constrain which ideas you have. But if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you'll have the opposite experience: hearing other people say surprising things will encourage you to think of more."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do independent-minded students face in a high school environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Independent-minded students often face challenges in a high school environment due to their discomfort being surrounded by conventional-minded peers. They tend to self-segregate when given the opportunity, but high school often does not provide that chance. Additionally, high school tends to be an inward-looking world whose inhabitants lack confidence, both of which magnify the forces of conformism. As a result, high school can be a challenging environment for independent-minded students."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What lesson can be learned from past experiences that helps in recognizing and avoiding undesirable situations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For the independent-minded, there is some advantage even here: it teaches you what to avoid. If you later find yourself in a situation that makes you think, \"This is like high school,\" you know you should get out."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do startup founders face as their companies grow and attract more conventional-minded employees?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another place where the independent-minded and conventional-minded are thrown together is in successful startups. The founders and early employees are almost always independent-minded; otherwise, the startup wouldn't be successful. However, conventional-minded people greatly outnumber independent-minded ones, so as the company grows, the original spirit of independent-mindedness is inevitably diluted. This causes all kinds of problems, besides the obvious one that the company starts to suffer. One of the strangest is that the founders find themselves able to speak more freely with founders of other companies than with their own employees."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some effective ways to connect with independent-minded individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fortunately, you don't have to spend all your time with independent-minded people. It's enough to have one or two you can talk to regularly. And once you find them, they're usually as eager to talk as you are; they need you too. Although universities no longer have the kind of monopoly they used to have on education, good universities are still an excellent way to meet independent-minded people. Most students will still be conventional-minded, but you'll at least find clumps of independent-minded ones, rather than the near zero you may have found in high school."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can diversifying your social circles benefit your personal growth and idea generation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Diversifying your social circles can significantly benefit your personal growth and idea generation. It works to go in the other direction: as well as cultivating a small collection of independent-minded friends, try to meet as many different types of people as you can. This approach will decrease the influence of your immediate peers if you have several other groups of peers. Plus, if you're part of several different worlds, you can often import ideas from one to another."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can engaging with individuals who have unique perspectives enhance personal learning and understanding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Engaging with individuals who have unique perspectives can greatly enhance personal learning and understanding. By different types of people, I don't mean demographically different. For this technique to work, they have to think differently. So while it's an excellent idea to go and visit other countries, you can probably find people who think differently right around the corner. When I meet someone who knows a lot about something unusual (which includes practically everyone, if you dig deep enough), I try to learn what they know that other people don't. There are almost always surprises here. It's a good way to make conversation when you meet strangers, but I don't do it to make conversation. I really want to know."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is reading history valuable for understanding different perspectives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reading history allows you to expand the source of influences in time as well as space. When I read history, I do it not just to learn what happened, but to try to get inside the heads of people who lived in the past. How did things look to them? This is hard to do, but worth the effort for the same reason it's worth traveling far to triangulate a point."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one develop a critical mindset towards conventional opinions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can also take more explicit measures to prevent yourself from automatically adopting conventional opinions. The most general is to cultivate an attitude of skepticism. When you hear someone say something, stop and ask yourself, \"Is that true?\" Don't say it out loud. I'm not suggesting that you impose on everyone who talks to you the burden of proving what they say, but rather that you take upon yourself the burden of evaluating what they say."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one approach accepted knowledge to uncover new ideas and insights?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Treat it as a puzzle. You know that some accepted ideas will later turn out to be wrong. See if you can guess which. The end goal is not to find flaws in the things you're told, but to find the new ideas that had been concealed by the broken ones. So this game should be an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for intellectual hygiene. And you'll be surprised when you start asking, \"Is this true?\" how often the answer is not an immediate yes. If you have any imagination, you're more likely to have too many leads to follow than too few."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key components of independent-mindedness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To go beyond this general advice, we need to look at the internal structure of independent-mindedness â at the individual muscles we need to exercise, as it were. It seems to me that it has three components: fastidiousness about truth, resistance to being told what to think, and curiosity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean to be fastidious about truth in terms of belief?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fastidiousness about truth means more than just not believing things that are false. It means being careful about the degree of belief. For most people, the degree of belief rushes unexamined toward the extremes: the unlikely becomes impossible, and the probable becomes certain."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do independent-minded individuals prioritize careful labeling of beliefs on topics they care about?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To the independent-minded, this seems unpardonably sloppy. They're willing to have anything in their heads, from highly speculative hypotheses to (apparent) tautologies, but on subjects they care about, everything has to be labeled with a carefully considered degree of belief."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the perspective of independent-minded individuals on ideologies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The independent-minded thus have a horror of ideologies, which require one to accept a whole collection of beliefs at once and to treat them as articles of faith. To an independent-minded person, that would seem revolting, just as it would seem to someone fastidious about food to take a bite of a submarine sandwich filled with a large variety of ingredients of indeterminate age and provenance."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is critical thinking about truth essential for genuine independent-mindedness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Without this fastidiousness about truth, you can't be truly independent-minded. It's not enough just to have resistance to being told what to think. Those kinds of people reject conventional ideas only to replace them with the most random conspiracy theories. And since these conspiracy theories have often been manufactured to capture them, they end up being less independent-minded than ordinary people because they're subject to a much more exacting master than mere convention."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one cultivate a greater appreciation for truth in themselves and others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Can you increase your fastidiousness about truth? I would think so. In my experience, merely thinking about something you're fastidious about causes that fastidiousness to grow. If so, this is one of those rare virtues we can have more of merely by wanting it. And if it's like other forms of fastidiousness, it should also be possible to encourage in children. I certainly got a strong dose of it from my father."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common misconception about the quality of independent-mindedness, particularly its aspect of resisting external influence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The second component of independent-mindedness, resistance to being told what to think, is the most visible of the three. However, even this is often misunderstood. The big mistake people make about it is thinking of it as a merely negative quality. The language we use reinforces that idea."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates independent-minded individuals to resist external influences on their thoughts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Independent-minded individuals are motivated to resist external influences on their thoughts because they care about what other people think. However, it's not just a kind of immunity. In the most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told what to think is a positive force. It's not mere skepticism, but an active engagement with their own beliefs and values."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between novelty, humor, and independent thinking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some of the most novel ideas seemed at the time almost like practical jokes. Think how often your reaction to a novel idea is to laugh. I don't think it's because novel ideas are funny per se, but because novelty and humor share a certain kind of surprisingness. While not identical, the two are close enough that there is a definite correlation between having a sense of humor and being independent-minded â just as there is between being humorless and being conventional-minded."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can individuals strengthen their independent-mindedness in a society that often imposes beliefs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't think we can significantly increase our resistance to being told what to think. It seems the most innate of the three components of independent-mindedness; people who have this quality as adults usually showed all too visible signs of it as children. But if we can't increase our resistance to being told what to think, we can at least shore it up by surrounding ourselves with other independent-minded people."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does curiosity play in the generation of novel ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The third component of independent-mindedness, curiosity, may be the most interesting. To the extent that we can give a brief answer to the question of where novel ideas come from, it's curiosity. That's what people are usually feeling before having them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What relationship exists between independent-mindedness and curiosity, particularly in children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In my experience, independent-mindedness and curiosity predict one another perfectly. Everyone I know who's independent-minded is deeply curious, and everyone I know who's conventional-minded isn't. Except, curiously, children. All small children are curious. Perhaps the reason is that even the conventional-minded have to be curious in the beginning in order to learn what the conventions are. Whereas the independent-minded are the gluttons of curiosity, who keep eating even after they're full."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key components that contribute to independent-mindedness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The three components of independent-mindedness work in concert: fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to think leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas to fill it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the components of truth, fastidiousness, and curiosity interact to enhance knowledge and understanding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Interestingly, the three components can substitute for one another in much the same way muscles can. If you're sufficiently fastidious about truth, you don't need to be as resistant to being told what to think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gaps in your knowledge. Either one can compensate for curiosity; if you create enough space in your brain, your discomfort at the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Alternatively, curiosity can compensate for them: if you're sufficiently curious, you don't need to clear space in your brain because the new ideas you discover will push out the conventional ones you acquired by default."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the different expressions of independent-mindedness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because the components of independent-mindedness are so interchangeable, you can have them to varying degrees and still get the same result. So there is not just a single model of independent-mindedness. Some independent-minded people are openly subversive, while others are quietly curious. They all know the secret handshake, though."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one enhance their curiosity in their current work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Is there a way to cultivate curiosity? To start with, you want to avoid situations that suppress it. How much does the work you're currently doing engage your curiosity? If the answer is \"not much,\" maybe you should change something."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can you actively cultivate your curiosity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most important active step you can take to cultivate your curiosity is probably to seek out the topics that engage it. Few adults are equally curious about everything, and it doesn't seem as if you can choose which topics interest you. So it's up to you to explore various subjects and find what truly captivates your attention."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can indulging your curiosity lead to further exploration and inquiry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indulging your curiosity can lead to further exploration and inquiry by encouraging you to investigate things you're interested in. Curiosity is unlike most other appetites in this respect: indulging it tends to increase rather than sate it. Questions lead to more questions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does curiosity play in discovering novel ideas compared to traditional notions of passion or love for a subject?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Curiosity seems to be more individual than fastidiousness about truth or resistance to being told what to think. To the degree people have the latter two, they're usually pretty general, whereas different people can be curious about very different things. So perhaps curiosity is the compass here. Perhaps, if your goal is to discover novel ideas, your motto should not be \"do what you love\" so much as \"do what you're curious about.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the reaction of traditionalists to the essay, and how did it differ from expectations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I expected a firestorm of rage from the aggressively conventional-minded, but in fact, it was quite muted. They sensed that there was something about the essay that they disliked intensely, but they had a hard time finding a specific passage to pin it on."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has Twitter influenced your thinking about independent versus conventional-mindedness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I ask myself what in my life is like high school, the answer is Twitter. It's not just full of conventional-minded people, as anything its size will inevitably be, but is also subject to violent storms of conventional-mindedness that remind me of descriptions of Jupiter. While it probably is a net loss to spend time there, it has at least made me think more about the distinction between independent- and conventional-mindedness, which I probably wouldn't have done otherwise."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential cultural implications of hiring new staff compared to maintaining company independence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most radical solution would be to grow revenues without growing the company. You think hiring that junior PR person will be cheap compared to a programmer, but what will be the effect on the average level of independent-mindedness in your company? (The growth in staff relative to faculty seems to have had a similar effect on universities.) Perhaps the rule about outsourcing work that's not your \"core competency\" should be augmented by one about outsourcing work done by people who would ruin your culture as employees."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do intellectual fashions impact the perception of politics compared to other fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are intellectual fashions in every field, but their influence varies. One of the reasons politics, for example, tends to be boring is that it's so extremely subject to them. The threshold for having opinions about politics is much lower than in other fields, leading to a proliferation of superficial analyses and trends that can overshadow substantive discussion."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between strong convictions and independent-mindedness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The conventional-minded are often fooled by the strength of their opinions into believing that they're independent-minded. However, strong convictions are not a sign of independent-mindedness; rather, they are the opposite."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do political extremists demonstrate conformity despite believing they are nonconformists?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You see this especially among political extremists. They think of themselves as nonconformists, but actually, they're niche conformists. Their opinions may be different from the average person's, but they are often more influenced by their peers' opinions than the average person's is."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the definition of fastidiousness about truth enhance our understanding of independent-mindedness in the arts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If we broaden the concept of fastidiousness about truth so that it excludes pandering, bogusness, and pomposity, as well as falsehood in the strict sense, our model of independent-mindedness can expand further into the arts."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What prevents many individuals from starting and completing meaningful projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame. This fear is not an irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on where they don't seem very impressive, even to their creators. You have to push through this stage to reach the great work that lies beyond. However, many people don't. Most people don't even reach the stage of making something they're embarrassed by, let alone continue past it. They're too frightened even to start."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do we struggle to evaluate ambitious projects during their early stages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We just don't have enough experience with early versions of ambitious projects to know how to respond to them. We judge them as we would judge more finished work or less ambitious projects. We don't realize they're a special case."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an example of a place that fosters innovative thinking and encourages unconventional ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Silicon Valley is one example of a place that fosters innovative thinking and encourages unconventional ideas. An unknown person working on a strange-sounding idea won't automatically be dismissed the way they would back home. In Silicon Valley, people have learned how dangerous that is to dismiss new and unconventional ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What skills are necessary for evaluating new ideas in a high-stakes environment like Y Combinator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Evaluating new ideas in a high-stakes environment like Y Combinator requires a range of skills, from listing the reasons an idea won't work to trying to think of ways it could. That's what I do when I meet people with new ideas. I've become quite good at it, but I've had a lot of practice. Being a partner at Y Combinator means being practically immersed in strange-sounding ideas proposed by unknown people. Every six months, you get thousands of new ones thrown at you and have to sort through them, knowing that in a world with a power-law distribution of outcomes, it will be painfully obvious if you miss the needle in this haystack. Optimism becomes urgent."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What potential impact could widespread optimism have on society and its customs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am hopeful that, with time, this kind of optimism can become widespread enough that it becomes a social custom, not just a trick used by a few specialists. After all, it is an extremely lucrative trick, and those tend to spread quickly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological factors contribute to the dismissal of ambitious new ideas by others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is another, more sinister reason people dismiss new ideas. If you try something ambitious, many of those around you will hope, consciously or unconsciously, that you'll fail. They worry that if you try something ambitious and succeed, it will put you above them. In some countries, this is not just an individual failing but part of the national culture."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often hope for your success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason many hope you'll succeed is that they hope to rise with you. For investors, this incentive is particularly explicit. They want you to succeed because they hope you'll make them rich in the process. However, many other people you meet can hope to benefit in some way from your success. At the very least, they'll be able to say, when you're famous, that they've known you since way back."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the culture of supporting startups in Silicon Valley evolved over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Silicon Valley's encouraging attitude is rooted in self-interest, but over time it has actually grown into a sort of benevolence. Encouraging startups has been practiced for so long that it has become a custom. Now, it just seems that that's what one does with startups."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can cultural attitudes towards new ideas evolve to encourage innovation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a lot more to new ideas than just new startup ideas, of course. The fear of making something lame holds people back in every field. However, Silicon Valley shows how quickly customs can evolve to support new ideas. This, in turn, proves that dismissing new ideas is not so deeply rooted in human nature that it can't be unlearned."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can misjudgments in goal assessment affect the perceived value of progress?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you overestimate the importance of what you're working on, that will compensate for your mistakenly harsh judgment of your initial results. If you look at something that's 20% of the way to a goal worth 100 and conclude that it's 10% of the way to a goal worth 200, your estimate of its expected value is correct even though both components are wrong."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological advantage does slight overconfidence provide in achieving success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It also helps, as Hardy suggests, to be slightly overconfident. I've noticed in many fields that the most successful people are slightly overconfident. On the face of it, this seems implausible. Surely it would be optimal to have exactly the right estimate of one's abilities. How could it be an advantage to be mistaken? Because this error compensates for other sources of error in the opposite direction: being slightly overconfident armors you against both other people's skepticism and your own."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential benefits of ignorance in the evaluation of early work, particularly for young individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ignorance has a similar effect. It's safe to make the mistake of judging early work as finished work if you're a sufficiently lax judge of finished work. I doubt it's possible to cultivate this kind of ignorance, but empirically, it's a real advantage, especially for the young."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can collaborating with the right colleagues enhance the progress of ambitious projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another way to get through the lame phase of ambitious projects is to surround yourself with the right peopleâto create an eddy in the social headwind. But it's not enough to collect people who are always encouraging; you'd learn to discount that. You need colleagues who can actually tell an ugly duckling from a baby swan. The people best able to do this are those working on similar projects of their own, which is why university departments and research labs work so well. You don't need institutions to collect colleagues; they naturally coalesce, given the chance. But it's very much worth accelerating this process by seeking out other people trying to do new things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do individuals face when trying to maintain discipline in the face of initial difficulties, especially as they age?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For some, it might work to rely on sheer discipline: to tell yourself that you just have to press on through the initial challenges and not get discouraged. But like a lot of \"just tell yourself\" advice, this is harder than it sounds. It gets even harder as you get older because your standards rise. The elderly do have one compensating advantage, though: they've been through this before."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can focusing on the rate of improvement rather than the current position alleviate concerns about the quality of work when starting something new?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Focusing on the rate of improvement rather than your current position can alleviate concerns about the quality of work when starting something new. You won't worry as much about doing bad work if you can see it improving. Obviously, the faster it improves, the easier this is. Therefore, when you start something new, it's beneficial if you can spend a lot of time on it. That's another advantage of being young: you tend to have bigger blocks of time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy can be used to overcome the pressure of perfectionism when starting a new creative project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another common trick is to start by considering new work to be of a different, less exacting type. For example, you might begin a painting by saying that it's just a sketch, or a new piece of software by saying that it's just a quick hack. Then, you can judge your initial results by a lower standard. Once the project is rolling, you can sneakily convert it to something more."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of medium is recommended for quick and low-commitment creative work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Using a medium that lets you work fast and doesn't require too much commitment up front will make this easier. It's easier to convince yourself that something is just a sketch when you're drawing in a notebook than when you're carving stone. Plus, you get initial results faster."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset can help one approach risky projects to maximize learning outcomes, even in the event of failure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It will be easier to try out a risky project if you think of it as a way to learn and not just as a way to make something. Then, even if the project truly is a failure, you'll still have gained from it. If the problem is sharply enough defined, failure itself is knowledge: if the theorem you're trying to prove turns out to be false, or you use a structural member of a certain size and it fails under stress, you've learned something, even if it isn't what you wanted to learn."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What personal motivation drives your entrepreneurial ventures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One motivation that works particularly well for me is curiosity. I like to try new things just to see how they'll turn out. We started Y Combinator in this spirit, and it was one of the main things that kept me going while I was working on it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated the author to explore the fundamental structure of Lisp through an axiomatic approach?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Having worked for so long with various dialects of Lisp, I was very curious to see what its inherent shape was: what you'd end up with if you followed the axiomatic approach all the way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to reframe your perception of early efforts in an ambitious project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Itâs a bit strange that you have to play mind games with yourself to avoid being discouraged by lame-looking early efforts. The thing youâre trying to trick yourself into believing is, in fact, the truth. A lame-looking early version of an ambitious project truly is more valuable than it seems. So the ultimate solution may be to teach yourself that."}]}

What were they thinking early on? What was the very first thing they did? It can sometimes be hard to get an accurate answer to this question because people are often embarrassed by their earliest work and make little effort to publish it. (They too misjudge it.) But when you can get an accurate picture of the first steps someone made on the path to great work, they're often pretty feeble."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can studying early work help improve your judgment and confidence in your own creative process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perhaps if you study enough such cases, you can teach yourself to be a better judge of early work.

As the commercial game quality improved over the years, it became almost a full-time job to make a successful mod that would be appreciated by the community. This was dramatically reversed with Minecraft and later Roblox, where the entire aesthetic of the experience was so explicitly crude that innovative gameplay concepts became the overriding value. These \"crude\" game mods by single authors are now often bigger deals than massive professional teams' work."}]}

That way, there's no such thing as failing since you learn something no matter what. You treat it like an experiment in the sense that if it really rules something out, you give up and move on. But if there's some way to vary it to make it work better, go ahead and do that."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do wealth taxes differ from income taxes in terms of their long-term impact on assets?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It may at first seem surprising that such apparently small tax rates produce such dramatic effects. A 2% wealth tax with a $50 million threshold takes about two-thirds of a successful founder's stock. The reason wealth taxes have such dramatic effects is that they're applied over and over to the same money. Income tax happens every year, but only to that year's income. Whereas if you live for 60 years after acquiring some asset, a wealth tax will tax that same asset 60 times. A wealth tax compounds. Note: In practice, eventually some of this 8% would come in the form of dividends, which are taxed as income at issue, so this model actually represents the most optimistic case for the founder."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can individuals be classified based on their conformism and mindset?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most revealing ways to classify people is by the degree and aggressiveness of their conformism. Imagine a Cartesian coordinate system whose horizontal axis runs from conventional-minded on the left to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axis runs from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The resulting four quadrants define four types of people. Starting in the upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively conventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively independent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence which quadrant individuals fall into within societal types?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think that you'll find all four types in most societies, and that which quadrant people fall into depends more on their own personality than the beliefs prevalent in their society."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do young children demonstrate about the influence of individual traits versus arbitrary rules in determining behavior types?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Young children offer some of the best evidence for both points. Anyone who's been to primary school has seen the four types, and the fact that school rules are so arbitrary is strong evidence that which quadrant people fall into depends more on them than on the rules."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characterizes the mindset of children who are considered passively conventional-minded?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The kids in the lower left quadrant, the passively conventional-minded, are the sheep.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics define the children in the lower right quadrant of the independence spectrum?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The kids in the lower right quadrant, the passively independent-minded, are the dreamy ones.

When they see a rule, their first impulse is to question it. Merely being told what to do makes them inclined to do the opposite."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the influence of peers on conformism change as children grow older?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When measuring conformism, of course, you have to say with respect to what, and this changes as kids get older. For younger kids, it's the rules set by adults. But as kids get older, the source of rules becomes their peers. So a pack of teenagers who all flout school rules in the same way are not independent-minded; rather, the opposite."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the four types of adult mindsets and how are they characterized?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In adulthood, we can recognize the four types by their distinctive calls, much as you could recognize four species of birds. The call of the aggressively conventional-minded is \"Crush <outgroup>!\" (It's rather alarming to see an exclamation point after a variable, but that's the whole problem with the aggressively conventional-minded.) The call of the passively conventional-minded is \"What will the neighbors think?\" The call of the passively independent-minded is \"To each his own.\" And the call of the aggressively independent-minded is \"Eppur si muove.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the relative sizes of the different personality types mentioned in the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The four types are not equally common. There are more passive people than aggressive ones, and far more conventional-minded people than independent-minded ones. Therefore, the passively conventional-minded are the largest group, and the aggressively independent-minded are the smallest."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does personality influence the quadrant a person occupies, regardless of societal rules?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since one's quadrant depends more on personality than the nature of the rules, most people would occupy the same quadrant even if they had grown up in a quite different society."}]}

In particular, the retirement of the concept of heresy and its replacement by the principle of freely debating all sorts of different ideas, even ones that are currently considered unacceptable, without any punishment for those who try them out to see if they work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to protect independent-minded individuals in society?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why is it important to protect independent-minded individuals in society? Because they have all the new ideas. To be a successful scientist, for example, it's not enough just to be right; you have to be right when everyone else is wrong. Conventional-minded people can't do that. For similar reasons, all successful startup CEOs are not merely independent-minded, but aggressively so. So it's no coincidence that societies prosper only to the extent that they have customs for keeping the conventional-minded at bay."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What concerns have been raised about the state of free inquiry in recent years?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the last few years, many of us have noticed that the customs protecting free inquiry have been weakened. Some say we're overreactingâthat they haven't been weakened very much, or that they've been weakened in the service of a greater good. The latter I'll dispose of immediately. When the conventional-minded get the upper hand, they always say it's in the service of a greater good. It just happens to be a different, incompatible greater good each time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are independent-minded individuals particularly attuned to changes in the freedom of idea exploration?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As for the former worry, that the independent-minded are being oversensitive and that free inquiry hasn't been shut down that much, you can't judge that unless you are yourself independent-minded. You can't know how much of the space of ideas is being lopped off unless you have them, and only the independent-minded have the ones at the edges. Precisely because of this, they tend to be very sensitive to changes in how freely one can explore ideas. They're the canaries in this coalmine."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential consequences of banning the discussion of certain ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The second reason it's dangerous to ban the discussion of ideas is that ideas are more closely related than they look. This means that if you restrict the discussion of some topics, it doesn't only affect those topics. The restrictions propagate back into any topic that yields implications in the forbidden ones. And that is not an edge case. The best ideas do exactly that: they have consequences in fields far removed from their origins. Having ideas in a world where some ideas are banned is like playing soccer on a pitch that has a minefield in one corner. You don't just play the same game you would have, but on a differently shaped pitch. You play a much more subdued game even on the ground that's safe."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What historical role have universities played in safeguarding independent thought and free inquiry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the past, the way the independent-minded protected themselves was to congregate in a handful of places â first in courts, and later in universities â where they could, to some extent, make their own rules. Places where people work with ideas tend to have customs protecting free inquiry, for the same reason wafer fabs have powerful air filters or recording studios good sound insulation. For the last couple of centuries at least, when the aggressively conventional-minded were on the rampage for whatever reason, universities were the safest places to be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role has social media played in the resurgence of intolerance that originated in universities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The latest wave of intolerance began in universities in the mid-1980s. By 2000, it seemed to have died down, but it has recently flared up again with the arrival of social media. This resurgence appears to be an unfortunate own goal by Silicon Valley. Although the people who run Silicon Valley are almost all independent-minded, they have handed the aggressively conventional-minded a tool they could only have dreamed of."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact has the departure of independent-minded individuals had on the current state of academic freedom in universities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "On the other hand, perhaps the decline in the spirit of free inquiry within universities is as much the symptom of the departure of the independent-minded as the cause. People who would have become professors 50 years ago have other options now; they can become quants or start startups. You have to be independent-minded to succeed at either of those. If these people had been professors, they would have put up a stiffer resistance on behalf of academic freedom. So perhaps the picture of the independent-minded fleeing declining universities is too gloomy. Perhaps the universities are declining because so many have already left."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What concerns does the author have about the future of independent-minded individuals in universities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Though I've spent a lot of time thinking about this situation, I can't predict how it will play out.

I worry a lot about what we might lose if that happens."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities enable independent-minded individuals to adapt and thrive in challenging situations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am hopeful long term.

If YC were a cookie company, Iâd have faced a difficult moral choice. Conventional-minded people eat cookies too, but they donât start successful startups.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What changes have occurred regarding the consequences for discussing banned ideas in richer countries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There has been progress in one area: the punishments for talking about banned ideas are less severe than in the past.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does privilege affect one's perception of social issues?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There has been a lot of talk about privilege lately.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the consequences of orthodox privilege on discussions of truth and heresy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the most extreme cases, people suffering from orthodox privilege will not only deny that there's anything true that you can't say, but will accuse you of heresy merely for saying there is. However, if there is more than one heresy current in your time, these accusations will be weirdly non-deterministic: you must either be an xist or a yist."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset do some individuals have regarding unconventional ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Frustrating as it is to deal with these people, it's important to realize that they're in earnest.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the main challenge in overcoming orthodox privilege compared to other forms of privilege?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, this is a uniquely tenacious form of privilege. People can overcome the blindness induced by most forms of privilege by learning more about whatever they're not. However, they can't overcome orthodox privilege just by learning more; they must become more independent-minded. If that happens at all, it doesn't occur on the time scale of one conversation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can we understand the concept of orthodox privilege in a similar way to scientific theories like dark matter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It may be possible to convince some people that orthodox privilege must exist even though they can't sense it, just as one can with, say, dark matter. There may be some who could be convinced, for example, that it's very unlikely that this is the first point in history at which there's nothing true you can't say, even if they can't imagine specific examples."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might individuals from conventional demographics fail to recognize their privilege?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In general, I don't think it will work to say \"check your privilege\" about this type of privilege, because those in its demographic don't realize they're in it. It doesn't seem to conventional-minded people that they're conventional-minded; it just seems to them that they're right. Indeed, they tend to be particularly sure of it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to respect others' perceptions and experiences, even if they differ from our own?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perhaps the solution is to appeal to politeness. If someone says they can hear a high-pitched noise that you can't, it's only polite to take them at their word instead of demanding evidence that's impossible to produce or simply denying that they hear anything. Imagine how rude that would seem. Similarly, if someone says they can think of things that are true but that cannot be said, it's only polite to take them at their word, even if you can't think of any yourself."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some individuals feel confident in making false predictions without fear of repercussions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer, I realized, is that they don't think they can get caught. They don't realize there is any danger in making false predictions. These people constantly make false predictions and get away with it because the things they make predictions about either have mushy enough outcomes that they can bluster their way out of trouble or happen so far in the future that few remember what they said."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some common flaws in academic writing that can undermine the clarity of statements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough merely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by making it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes useful writing from less effective statements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing.

However, if I say it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because it's a bit east of the middle."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between surprising someone with new information and providing insights that they unconsciously knew?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean surprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact, those may be the more valuable insights because they tend to be more fundamental."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean for an idea to be considered novel in the context of a large population?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An idea is considered novel in the context of a large population when it is unique or original to a significant number of people, even if it is not entirely new to everyone. For example, you can't expect an idea to be novel to everyone; any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's 7 billion people. However, it is sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot of readers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the components of correctness, importance, and strength be quantified to assess usefulness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Correctness, importance, and strength can be quantified to assess usefulness.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy can help ensure that your statements are meaningful and valuable?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To ensure that your statements are meaningful and valuable, consider this strategy: Don't say anything unless you're sure it's worth hearing. I learned this trick from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying anything dumb. This approach makes it hard to get opinions out of him, but when you do, they're usually right."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should a writer do with unsatisfactory sentences or sections in their essay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write a bad sentence, you don't publish it.

When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily written, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. The annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or so, I'm saying \"Ugh, that part\" each time I hit it. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past.

It's like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can writers ensure their work remains novel and engaging for readers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To ensure that their work remains novel and engaging for readers, writers should focus on topics they have deeply contemplated. By using their own insights as a proxy for the reader, writers can identify elements that may surprise them, which are likely to also surprise a significant number of readers. Additionally, employing the Morris technique can help guarantee the relevance and correctness of the content. Ultimately, if a writer does not learn anything from writing an essay, it is advisable not to publish it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does confidence contribute to humility in recognizing new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You need humility to measure novelty because acknowledging the novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of it. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in this case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble. If you know you're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit when you learn something you didn't know because you can be confident that most other people wouldn't know it either."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two key factors that contribute to the strength of useful writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two things: thinking well and the skillful use of qualification. These two counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch in a car with a manual transmission. As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something you're sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all, as I did with the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm's length with \"perhapses.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between refining an idea and the level of qualification it contains?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As you refine an idea, you're pushing in the direction of less qualification. However, you can rarely get it down to zero. Sometimes you don't even want to, especially if it's a side point and a fully refined version would be too long."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might some writers choose to include phrases like \"I think\" in their writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some say that qualifications weaken writing. For example, that you should never begin a sentence in an essay with \"I think,\" because if you're saying it, then of course you think it. And it's true that \"I think x\" is a weaker statement than simply \"x.\" Which is exactly why you need \"I think.\" You need it to express your degree of certainty."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of understanding and using qualifications in effective communication and idea formulation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Qualifications are not scalars; they're not just experimental error. There are many things they can express: how broadly something applies, how you know it, how happy you are that it's so, and even how it could be falsified. I'm not going to try to explore the structure of qualification here; it's probably more complex than the whole topic of writing usefully. Instead, I'll just give you a practical tip: Don't underestimate qualification. It's an important skill in its own right, not just a sort of tax you have to pay in order to avoid saying things that are false. So, learn and use its full range. It may not be fully half of having good ideas, but it's part of having them."}]}

But I don't think this is a component of usefulness. It's more a matter of consideration for the reader, and it's a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language. But I'll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader's sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program that's too long."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the Morris technique impact the perceived confidence of a writer's arguments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Using the Morris technique, your writing will seem quite confidentâperhaps offensively confident to people who disagree with you. The reason you'll seem confident is that you are confident: you've filtered your work by only publishing the things you're sure of. To those who try to disagree with you, it may appear that you never admit you're wrong. In fact, you constantly admit you're wrong; you just do it before publishing instead of after."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might a well-written essay still face criticism despite being correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You might think that if you work sufficiently hard to ensure that an essay is correct, it will be invulnerable to attack. That's sort of true. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. But in practice, that's little consolation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can strong language in writing lead to misrepresentation of ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, the strength component of useful writing will make you particularly vulnerable to misrepresentation. If you've stated an idea as strongly as you could without making it false, all anyone has to do is exaggerate slightly what you said, and now it is false."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common misunderstanding occurs between writers and their critics during discussions or debates?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Much of the time, they're not even doing it deliberately. One of the most surprising things you'll discover, if you start writing essays, is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with what you've actually written. Instead, they make up something you said and disagree with that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might it be beneficial to address potential misinterpretations in communication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Should you explicitly forestall likely misinterpretations? Yes, if they're misinterpretations a reasonably smart and well-intentioned person might make. In fact, it's sometimes better to say something slightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get an idea right in one shot. That can be more efficient and can also model the way such an idea would be discovered."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on addressing potential misinterpretations in an essay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I don't think you should explicitly forestall intentional misinterpretations in the body of an essay. An essay is a place to meet honest readers. You don't want to spoil your house by putting bars on the windows to protect against dishonest ones. The place to protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes. But don't think you can predict them all. People are as ingenious at misrepresenting you when you say something they don't want to hear as they are at coming up with rationalizations for things they want to do but know they shouldn't. I suspect it's the same skill."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should a beginner focus on when starting to write?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you narrow the topic sufficiently, you can probably find something you're an expert on. Write about that to start with. If you only have ten readers who care, that's fine. You're helping them, and you're writing. Later, you can expand the breadth of topics you write about."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of writing essays without the intention of publishing them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other constraint you can relax is a little surprising: publication. Writing essays doesn't have to mean publishing them. That may seem strange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, but it worked for me. I wrote what amounted to essays in notebooks for about 15 years. I never published any of them and never expected to. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. But when the web came along, I'd had a lot of practice."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What sparked his interest in computer design during high school despite financial limitations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In high school, he designed computers on paper for fun. He couldn't build them because he couldn't afford the components. But when Intel launched 4K DRAMs in 1975, he was ready."}]}

The answer to that question is probably the most exciting thing I've learned about essay writing: nearly all of them are left to write.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors limited the development of essay writing during the print era?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Essay writing is an old form, but it hasn't been assiduously cultivated. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there wasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many. You could publish essays if you were already well-known for writing something else, like novels. Alternatively, you could write book reviews that you took over to express your own ideas. However, there was not really a direct path to becoming an essayist, which meant few essays got written, and those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What opportunities does the internet provide for aspiring writers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now, thanks to the internet, there's a path. Anyone can publish essays online. You start in obscurity, perhaps, but at least you can start. You don't need anyone's permission."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What recent developments have led to a resurgence of interest in certain areas of knowledge?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It sometimes happens that an area of knowledge sits quietly for years until some change makes it explode. Cryptography did this to number theory. The internet is doing it to the essay."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of writing essays in relation to discovering new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The exciting thing is not that there's a lot left to write, but that there's a lot left to discover. There's a certain kind of idea that's best discovered by writing essays. If most essays are still unwritten, most such ideas are still undiscovered."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do you feel like you are always learning and encountering unfamiliar situations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I constantly feel like a noob.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between feeling like a beginner in a local context and one's overall experience on a global scale?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not pleasant to feel like a noob. The word \"noob\" is certainly not a compliment. And yet today I realized something encouraging about being a noob: the more of a noob you are locally, the less of a noob you are globally."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the reasons for our discomfort with feeling inexperienced or like a \"noob\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think the answer is that there are two sources of feeling like a noob: being stupid and doing something novel. Our dislike of feeling like a noob is our brain telling us, \"Come on, come on, figure this out.\" This was the right thing to be thinking for most of human history. The life of hunter-gatherers was complex, but it didn't change as much as life does now. They didn't suddenly have to figure out what to do about cryptocurrency. So, it made sense to be biased toward competence at existing problems over the discovery of new ones. It made sense for humans to dislike the feeling of being a noob, just as, in a world where food was scarce, it made sense for them to dislike the feeling of being hungry."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes \"fanboys\" from regular fans in the context of fame?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you become sufficiently famous, you'll acquire some fans who like you too much. These people are sometimes called \"fanboys,\" and though I dislike that term, I'm going to have to use it here. We need some word for them because this is a distinct phenomenon from someone simply liking your work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the characteristics of a fanboy's admiration for someone?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A fanboy is obsessive and uncritical. Liking you becomes part of their identity, and they create an image of you in their own head that is much better than reality. Everything you do is good because you do it. If you do something bad, they find a way to see it as good. Their love for you is not usually a quiet, private one; they want everyone to know how great you are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics define a hater's perception and behavior towards someone they dislike?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A hater is obsessive and uncritical. Disliking you becomes part of their identity, and they create an image of you in their own head that is much worse than reality. Everything you do is bad because you do it. If you do something good, they find a way to see it as bad. Their dislike for you is usually not a quiet, private one; they want everyone to know how awful you are."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the author come to about the nature of haters?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I spent years puzzling about haters. What are they, and where do they come from? Then one day it dawned on me: haters are just fanboys with the sign switched."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes a hater from a casual critic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Note that by \"haters,\" I don't simply mean trolls. I'm not talking about people who say bad things about you and then move on. I'm talking about the much smaller group of people for whom this becomes a kind of obsession and who do it repeatedly over a long period."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does fame play in the existence of haters towards celebrities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like fans, haters seem to be an automatic consequence of fame. Anyone sufficiently famous will have them. And like fans, haters are energized by the fame of whoever they hate. They hear a song by some pop singer. They don't like it much. If the singer were an obscure one, they'd just forget about it. But instead, they keep hearing her name, and this seems to drive some people crazy. Everyone's always going on about this singer, but she's no good! She's a fraud!"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological mechanisms might lead someone to develop a strong dislike for a famous singer?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They can't deny their fame. Indeed, their fame is, if anything, exaggerated in the hater's mind. They notice every mention of the singer's name because every mention makes them angrier. In their own minds, they exaggerate both the singer's fame and her lack of talent, and the only way to reconcile those two ideas is to conclude that she has tricked everyone."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates some individuals to become haters despite having talent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Haters are not always complete losers. They are not always the proverbial guy living in his mom's basement. Many are, but some have some amount of talent. In fact, I suspect that a sense of frustrated talent is what drives some people to become haters. They're not just saying, \"It's unfair that so-and-so is famous,\" but \"It's unfair that so-and-so is famous, and not me.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the perspective on haters help in managing their behavior?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Knowing that haters are just fanboys with the sign bit flipped makes it much easier to deal with them. We don't need a separate theory of haters; we can just use existing techniques for dealing with obsessive fans."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you focus on when dealing with haters after becoming famous?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most important thing is simply not to think much about them. If you're like most people who become famous enough to acquire haters, your initial reaction will be one of mystification. Why does this guy seem to have it in for me? Where does his obsessive energy come from, and what makes him so appallingly nasty? What did I do to set him off? Is it something I can fix?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between dealing with a hater and resolving a dispute?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The mistake here is to think of the hater as someone you have a dispute with. When you have a dispute with someone, it's usually a good idea to try to understand why they're upset and then fix things if you can. Disputes are distracting. But it's a false analogy to think of a hater as someone you have a dispute with. It's an understandable mistake if you've never encountered haters before. But when you realize that you're dealing with a hater, and what a hater is, it's clear that it's a waste of time even to think about them. If you have obsessive fans, do you spend any time wondering what makes them love you so much? No, you just think, \"some people are kind of crazy,\" and that's the end of it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can we determine if someone is genuinely a fraud or if the criticism against them is based on personal biases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You distinguish between X calling Y a fraud because X is a hater and because Y is a fraud. Look at neutral opinion. Actual frauds are usually pretty conspicuous. Thoughtful people are rarely taken in by them. So if there are some thoughtful people who like Y, you can usually assume Y is not a fraud."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two types of political moderates and how do they differ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two distinct ways to be politically moderate: on purpose and by accident. Intentional moderates are trimmers, deliberately choosing a position midway between the extremes of right and left. Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they make up their own minds about each question, and the far right and far left are roughly equally wrong."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one differentiate between intentional and accidental moderates based on their opinion distribution?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the distribution of their opinions. If the far-left opinion on some matter is 0 and the far-right opinion is 100, an intentional moderate's opinion on every question will be near 50. In contrast, an accidental moderate's opinions will be scattered over a broad range but will, like those of the intentional moderate, average to about 50."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do intentional moderates' beliefs reflect the influence of broader political trends, similar to ideologues on the far left and right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Intentional moderates are similar to those on the far left and the far right in that their opinions are, in a sense, not their own. The defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or the right, is to acquire one's opinions in bulk. You don't get to pick and choose. Your opinions about taxation can be predicted from your opinions about sex. Although intentional moderates might seem to be the opposite of ideologues, their beliefs (though in their case the word \"positions\" might be more accurate) are also acquired in bulk. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left, the intentional moderate must shift with it. Otherwise, they stop being moderate."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes accidental moderates from traditional political groups in terms of their engagement with political questions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Accidental moderates, on the other hand, not only choose their own answers but also choose their own questions. They may not care at all about questions that the left and right both think are terribly important. Therefore, you can only measure the politics of an accidental moderate from the intersection of the questions they care about and those the left and right care about, and this can sometimes be vanishingly small."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do accidental moderates face compared to intentional moderates in a politically polarized environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by the extreme left. While it may be accurate to call intentional moderates cowards, openly being an accidental moderate requires the most courage of all, because you get attacked from both the right and the left, and you don't have the comfort of being an orthodox member of a large group to sustain you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between independent thinking in mathematics and political ideologies according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You have to be independent-minded about the ideas you work with. You could be mindlessly doctrinaire in your politics and still be a good mathematician. In the 20th century, a lot of very smart people were Marxists â just no one who was smart about the subjects Marxism involves. But if the ideas you use in your work intersect with the politics of your time, you have two choices: be an accidental moderate or be mediocre."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What observation can be made about the exploration of possibilities in various fields despite significant effort from many individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Iâve seen the same pattern in many different fields: even though lots of people have worked hard in the field, only a small fraction of the space of possibilities has been explored because theyâve all worked on similar things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some promising areas to explore for innovative solutions in seemingly saturated fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you want to try working on unfashionable problems, one of the best places to look is in fields that people think have already been fully explored: essays, Lisp, venture funding â you may notice a pattern here. If you can find a new approach into a big but apparently played-out field, the value of whatever you discover will be significant."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were your feelings about having children before you became a parent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point, I felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living virtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children. But did I want them now? No."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the author's true feelings about other people having babies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically because that seemed to be what one did.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did becoming a parent influence your feelings towards the safety of others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Partly, and I won't deny it, this is because of serious chemical changes that happened almost instantly when our first child was born. It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt protective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was driving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached a crosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking, \"I have to be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is someone's child!\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the selection bias in the author's observations of parents and children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in my observations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticed that I wrote, \"Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids.\" Of course, the times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only noticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticed them? Ordinarily, I never went to places with kids, so the only times I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes, which is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler is something very few parents enjoy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some of the quiet yet profound moments that parents experience with their children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What I didn't notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were all the great moments parents had with kids. People don't talk about these much â the magic is hard to put into words, and all other parents know about them anyway â but one of the great things about having kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is nowhere else you'd rather be and nothing else you'd rather be doing. You don't have to be doing anything special. You could just be going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing them on the swings at the park. But you wouldn't trade these moments for anything. One doesn't tend to associate kids with peace, but that's what you feel. You don't need to look any further than where you are right now."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What misconceptions did the author have about parenthood based on their childhood experiences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that was similarly misleading. I was pretty bad and was always in trouble for something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood was essentially law enforcement. I didn't realize there were good times too."}]}

My god, I thought, this woman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjected her to but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling the truth."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unexpected joys and friendships can arise from parenting, according to the author's experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "She said that one reason she liked having us was that we'd been interesting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids. You don't just love them; they become your friends too. They're really interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously fond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fifty times), it's often genuinely fun to play with them. That surprised me too. Playing with a 2-year-old was fun when I was 2 and definitely not fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it does."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does having children impact an adult's productivity and time management?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some of my worries about having kids were right, though. They definitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some people get their act together, but if your act was already together, you're going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you're going to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules. I'm not sure if it's because that's how kids are or because it's the only way to integrate their lives with adults', but once you have kids, you tend to have to work on their schedule."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has becoming a parent affected your work-life balance and productivity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've been able to adapt to working this way.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does having children impact personal ambition and priorities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part of my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. It hurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. But if there weren't something real there, why would I squirm? The fact is, once you have kids, you're probably going to care more about them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sum game. Only one idea at a time can be the focus."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated the speaker to complete their task?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I told my kids that once I finished it, I'd take them to Africa. When you say that sort of thing to a little kid, they treat it as a promise. Which meant I had to finish or I'd be taking away their trip to Africa.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What aspects of pre-parenthood life does the speaker miss the most?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And while having kids may be warping my present judgment, it hasn't overwritten my memory.

Why did I never do that?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has your perception of happiness changed after becoming a parent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I had plenty of happy times before I had kids.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What emotions and concerns do parents commonly experience before and after having children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People's experiences as parents vary a lot, and I know I've been lucky.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What perspective on education did a philosophy grad student share with you in college?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I was in college, a particularly earnest philosophy grad student once told me that he never cared what grade he got in a class, only what he learned in it. This stuck in my mind because it was the only time I ever heard anyone say such a thing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the focus on grades impact your learning experience in college?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For me, as for most students, the measurement of what I was learning completely dominated actual learning in college. I was fairly earnest; I was genuinely interested in most of the classes I took, and I worked hard. And yet, I worked by far the hardest when I was studying for a test."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the intended purpose of tests in an educational context?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In theory, tests are merely what their name implies: tests of what you've learned in the class. In theory, you shouldn't have to prepare for a test in a class any more than you have to prepare for a blood test. In theory, you learn from taking the class, from going to the lectures, and doing the reading and/or assignments, and the test that comes afterward merely measures how well you learned."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is conflating learning with grades considered detrimental?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, it is bad. It wasn't until decades after college, when I was running Y Combinator, that I realized how detrimental it is to conflate learning with grades."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some limitations of traditional testing methods in evaluating true learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I knew, of course, when I was a student that studying for a test is far from identical with actual learning. At the very least, you don't retain knowledge you cram into your head the night before an exam. But the problem is worse than that. The real problem is that most tests don't come close to measuring what they're supposed to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can students benefit from accessing old exams in their university courses?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At a university, there are often copies of old exams floating around, and these narrow down what you have to learn. As well as learning what kind of questions this professor asks, you'll often get actual exam questions, as many professors re-use them. After teaching a class for 10 years, it would be hard not to, at least inadvertently."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "In which types of classes might a student need to align with their professor's political views to succeed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In some classes, your professor will have had some sort of political axe to grind, and if so, you'll have to grind it too. The need for this varies. In classes in math, the hard sciences, or engineering, it's rarely necessary, but at the other end of the spectrum, there are classes where you couldn't get a good grade without it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of prioritizing grades over actual learning in education?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Getting a good grade in a class on x is so different from learning a lot about x that you have to choose one or the other, and you can't blame students if they choose grades. Everyone judges them by their grades â graduate programs, employers, scholarships, even their own parents."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated your focus on grades over learning during your college experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I liked learning, and I really enjoyed some of the papers and programs I wrote in college. But did I ever, after turning in a paper in some class, sit down and write another just for fun? Of course not. I had things due in other classes. If it ever came to a choice of learning or grades, I chose grades. I hadn't come to college to do badly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do students at elite universities feel compelled to prioritize grades over genuine learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Anyone who cares about getting good grades has to play this game, or they'll be surpassed by those who do. At elite universities, that means nearly everyone, since someone who didn't care about getting good grades probably wouldn't be there in the first place.

Their job is to teach, not to create unhackable tests. The real problem is grades, or more precisely, that grades have been overloaded. If grades were merely a way for teachers to tell students what they were doing right and wrong, like a coach giving advice to an athlete, students wouldn't be tempted to hack tests. But unfortunately, after a certain age, grades become more than advice. After a certain age, whenever you're being taught, you're usually also being judged."}]}

How, they would ask, do you raise money? What's the trick for making venture capitalists want to invest in you? The best way to make VCs want to invest in you, I would explain, is to actually be a good investment. Even if you could trick VCs into investing in a bad startup, you'd be tricking yourselves too. You're investing time in the same company you're asking them to invest money in. If it's not a good investment, why are you even doing it?"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do many founders struggle to approach challenges effectively?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why do founders tie themselves in knots doing the wrong things when the answer is right in front of them? Because that is what they've been trained to do. Their education has taught them that the way to win was to hack the test, and without even telling them they were being trained to do this. The younger ones, the recent graduates, have never faced a non-artificial test. They think this is just how the world works: that the first thing you do when facing any kind of challenge is to figure out what the trick is for hacking the test. That's why the conversation always starts with how to raise money, because that reads as the test. It comes at the end of YC, has numbers attached to it, and higher numbers seem to be better. It must be the test."}]}

This phenomenon isn't limited to schools. Some people, either due to ideology or ignorance, claim that this is true of startups too. But it isn't. In fact, one of the most striking things about startups is the degree to which you win by simply doing good work. There are edge cases, as there are in anything, but in general, you win by getting users, and what users care about is whether the product does what they want."}]}

After you've noticed it, it seems like the elephant in the room, but it's a pretty well-camouflaged elephant. The phenomenon is so old and so pervasive, and it's simply the result of neglect. No one meant for things to be this way; this is just what happens when you combine learning with grades, competition, and the naive assumption of unhackability."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How is the erosion of authority impacting traditional roles in work and creative fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hacking bad tests is becoming less important as the link between work and authority erodes. The erosion of that link is one of the most important trends happening now, and we see its effects in almost every kind of work people do.

Imagine what happens as more and more people start to ask themselves if they want to win by hacking bad tests and decide that they don't. The kinds of work where you win by hacking bad tests will be starved of talent, and the kinds where you win by doing good work will see an influx of the most ambitious people.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the different meanings of the term \"hacking\" in relation to problem-solving and testing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hacking has multiple senses. There's a narrow sense in which it means to compromise something; that's the sense in which one hacks a bad test. But there's another, more general sense, meaning to find a surprising solution to a problem, often by thinking differently about it. Hacking in this sense is a wonderful thing. Indeed, some of the hacks people use on bad tests are impressively ingenious; the problem is not so much the hacking as that, because the tests are hackable, they don't test what they're meant to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do innovators face when pursuing non-obvious ideas that contradict widely held assumptions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To discover new things, you have to work on ideas that are good but non-obvious; if an idea is obviously good, other people are probably already working on it. One common way for a good idea to be non-obvious is for it to be hidden in the shadow of some mistaken assumption that people are very attached to. However, anything you discover from working on such an idea will tend to contradict the mistaken assumption that was concealing it. Thus, you will likely face a lot of heat from people attached to the mistaken assumption. Galileo and Darwin are famous examples of this phenomenon, but it's probably always an ingredient in the resistance to new ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential risks of suppressing heretical ideas within an organization or society?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is particularly dangerous for an organization or society to have a culture of pouncing on heresy. When you suppress heresies, you don't just prevent people from contradicting the mistaken assumption you're trying to protect; you also suppress any idea that implies indirectly that it's false."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between mistaken assumptions and the exploration of new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Every cherished mistaken assumption has a dead zone of unexplored ideas around it.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates a bus ticket collector's passion for their hobby?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A bus ticket collector's love is disinterested; they are not doing it to impress us or to make themselves rich, but for its own sake. This leads us to the second feature of this kind of obsession: there is no point."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common trait do many successful individuals share in their early pursuits?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you look at the lives of people who've done great work, you see a consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket collector's obsessive interest in something that would have seemed pointless to most of their contemporaries. One of the most striking features of Darwin's book about his voyage on the Beagle is the sheer depth of his interest in natural history. His curiosity seems infinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out on his slate what happens to series."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do interest and aptitude influence determination in pursuing a topic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Aren't I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than you might think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for ability and a substitute for determination. Unless you have sufficient mathematical aptitude, you won't find series interesting. And when you're obsessively interested in something, you don't need as much determination; you don't need to push yourself as hard when curiosity is pulling you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does an obsessive interest contribute to success and opportunities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An obsessive interest will even bring you luck, to the extent that anything can.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of disinterestedness in the context of obsession and idea generation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The disinterestedness of this kind of obsession is its most important feature, not just because it's a filter for earnestness, but because it helps you discover new ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the discovery of innovative ideas that others often overlook?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The paths that lead to new ideas tend to look unpromising. If they looked promising, other people would already have explored them. How do the people who do great work discover these paths that others overlook? The popular story is that they simply have better vision: because they're so talented, they see paths that others miss. But if you look at the way great discoveries are made, that's not what happens. Darwin didn't pay closer attention to individual species than other people because he saw that this would lead to great discoveries, and they didn't. He was just really, really interested in such things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes the discoveries of individuals like Darwin and Ramanujan from those driven solely by ambition?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Darwin couldn't turn it off. Neither could Ramanujan. They didn't discover the hidden paths that they did because they seemed promising, but because they couldn't help it. That's what allowed them to follow paths that someone who was merely ambitious would have ignored."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes the bus ticket theory of genius from Carlyle's definition?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The bus ticket theory is similar to Carlyle's famous definition of genius as an infinite capacity for taking pains. However, there are two differences. The bus ticket theory makes it clear that the source of this infinite capacity for taking pains is not infinite diligence, as Carlyle seems to have meant, but the sort of infinite interest that collectors have. It also adds an important qualification: an infinite capacity for taking pains about something that matters."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to pursue your interests when exploring new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is important to pursue your interests when exploring new ideas because you can never be sure which paths are promising. It's precisely because no one can tell in advance that you can discover new ideas by working on what you're interested in."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors indicate that an obsession might be significant or meaningful?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an obsession might be one that matters. For example, it's more promising if you're creating something, rather than just consuming something someone else creates. It's more promising if something you're interested in is difficult, especially if it's challenging."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes the interests of talented individuals from those of others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The obsessions of talented people are more likely to be promising. When talented individuals become interested in random things, they're not truly random. Their interests are often driven by a deeper understanding or a unique perspective that sets them apart from others."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the relationship between reward and risk apply to achieving great work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In many different areas, reward is proportionate to risk. If that rule holds here, then the way to find paths that lead to truly great work is to be willing to expend a lot of effort on things that turn out to be every bit as unpromising as they seem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential risks and rewards of choosing conventional paths over personal passions in uncertain situations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What can one do in the face of such uncertainty? One solution is to hedge your bets, which in this case means to follow the obviously promising paths instead of your own private obsessions. But as with any hedge, you're decreasing reward when you decrease risk. If you forgo working on what you like in order to follow some more conventionally ambitious path, you might miss something wonderful that you'd otherwise have discovered. That too must happen all the time, perhaps even more often than the genius whose bets all fail."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential benefits and risks of pursuing multiple interests or projects simultaneously?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other solution is to let yourself be interested in lots of different things. You don't decrease your upside if you switch between equally genuine interests based on which seems to be working so far. But there is a danger here too: if you work on too many different projects, you might not get deeply enough into any of them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the bus ticket theory account for the variations in success among individuals in different fields of work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One interesting thing about the bus ticket theory is that it may help explain why different types of people excel at different kinds of work. Interest is much more unevenly distributed than ability. If natural ability is all you need to do great work, and natural ability is evenly distributed, you have to invent elaborate theories to explain the skewed distributions we see among those who actually do great work in various fields. But it may be that much of the skew has a simpler explanation: different people are interested in different things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can cultivating interest contribute to the development of genius?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most exciting implication of the bus ticket theory is that it suggests ways to encourage great work. If the recipe for genius is simply natural ability plus hard work, all we can do is hope we have a lot of ability and work as hard as we can. However, if interest is a critical ingredient in genius, we may be able, by cultivating interest, to cultivate genius."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the bus ticket theory suggest about pursuing ambitious goals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For the very ambitious, the bus ticket theory suggests that the way to do great work is to relax a little.

If you're stuck, that may be the vector along which to break out."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What self-reflective questions can help you evaluate your current work priorities and explore personal interests?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A famous double-barreled question is: what are the most important problems in your field, and why aren't you working on one of them? It's a great way to shake yourself up. But it may be overfitting a bit. It might be at least as useful to ask yourself: if you could take a year off to work on something that probably wouldn't be important but would be really interesting, what would it be?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the bus ticket theory imply about the relationship between age and creativity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The bus ticket theory suggests a way to avoid slowing down as you get older. Perhaps the reason people have fewer new ideas as they get older is not simply that they're losing their edge. It may also be because, once you become established, you can no longer mess about with irresponsible side projects the way you could when you were young and no one cared what you did."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can encouraging students to pursue their interests lead to deeper learning experiences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When they get interested in something, however random, I encourage them to go preposterously, bus ticket collectorly, deep. I don't do this because of the bus ticket theory. I do it because I want them to feel the joy of learning, and they're never going to feel that about something I'm making them learn. It has to be something they're interested in. I'm just following the path of least resistance; depth is a byproduct. But if, in trying to show them the joy of learning, I also end up training them to go deep, so much the better."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might someone choose to use a less popular example when discussing hobbies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Using a less popular example when discussing hobbies can be beneficial because it avoids offending individuals who may feel that their interests are not valued. While more popular examples may resonate with a larger audience, they can also overshadow less common hobbies. It seems just as well to use an inferior example rather than offend more people by telling them their hobby doesn't matter."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "To what extent is a child's interest in subjects like math influenced by innate tendencies versus external encouragement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My experience so far suggests the answer is: most of it is inborn. Different kids get interested in different things, and it's hard to make a child interested in something they wouldn't otherwise be. Not in a way that sticks. The most you can do on behalf of a topic is to make sure it gets a fair showing â to make it clear to them, for example, that there's more to math than the dull drills they do in school.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies can be employed to generate moderately valuable insights from general ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Moderately valuable insights can be generated through small additions of whichever quality was missing. The more common case is a small addition of generality: a piece of gossip that is more than just gossip because it teaches something interesting about the world. Another, less common approach is to focus on the most general ideas and see if you can find something new to say about them. Because these start out so general, you only need a small delta of novelty to produce a useful insight."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you expect when trying to generate new ideas, and how can you stay motivated despite similarities to existing concepts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A small delta of novelty is all you'll be able to get most of the time. This means that if you take this route, your ideas will seem a lot like ones that already exist. Sometimes you'll find you've merely rediscovered an idea that did already exist.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it acceptable to repeat general ideas in writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Corollary: the more general the ideas you're talking about, the less you should worry about repeating yourself. If you write enough, it's inevitable you will. Your brain is much the same from year to year, and so are the stimuli that hit it. I feel slightly bad when I find I've said something close to what I've said before, as if I were plagiarizing myself. But rationally, one shouldn't. You won't say something exactly the same way the second time, and that variation increases the chance you'll get that tiny but critical delta of novelty."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can small, novel ideas contribute to larger innovations despite criticism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An idea with a small amount of novelty could lead to one with more, but only if you keep going.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might powerful individuals who lack charisma face criticism despite their qualifications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Powerful individuals who lack charisma tend to be disliked.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do biographies of famous scientists influence our perception of their willingness to take risks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because biographies of famous scientists tend to edit out their mistakes, we underestimate the degree of risk they were willing to take.

Perhaps the intelligence and the eccentricity were not as separate as we think. Physics seems to us a promising field to work on, while alchemy and theology appear to be obvious wastes of time. But that's because we know how things turned out. In Newton's day, the three fields seemed roughly equally promising. No one knew yet what the payoff would be for inventing what we now call physics; if they had, more people would have been working on it.

Most 25 to 29-year-olds want to live in the city, not in the boring suburbs. So, whether they like it or not, founders know they have to be in the city. I know multiple founders who would have preferred to live down in the Valley proper but made themselves move to SF because they knew otherwise they'd lose the talent war."}]}

That means you're 0.8% ahead. The population is 306,000, so we're talking about a surplus of about 2,500 people. That's the population of a small town, and that's just the surplus.

Like San Francisco and New York, Pittsburgh is fortunate to be a pre-car city. It's not too spread out, which is important because those 25 to 29-year-olds do not like driving. They prefer walking, bicycling, or taking public transport. If you've been to San Francisco recently, you can't help but notice the huge number of bicyclists. This is not just a fad that the twenty-somethings have adopted; in this respect, they have discovered a better way to live. The beards will go, but not the bikes. Cities where you can get around without driving are just better, period. So I would suggest you do everything you can to capitalize on this.

While cool old neighborhoods and charming little restaurants contribute to its appeal, they are not the only factors. Pittsburgh is in a much better position than Portland because it boasts a first-rate research university.

The histories of the most successful startups reveal that they often grow organically from a couple of founders building something that starts as an interesting side project. Universities are great at bringing together founders, but beyond that, the best thing they can do is get out of the way. For example, they can refrain from claiming ownership of the \"intellectual property\" that students and faculty develop and maintain liberal rules about deferred admission and leaves of absence."}]}

Harvard used to have exams for the fall semester after Christmas. At the beginning of January, they had something called \"Reading Period,\" when students were supposed to be studying for exams. Microsoft and Facebook have something in common that few people realize: they were both started during Reading Period. It's the perfect situation for producing the sort of side projects that turn into startups. The students are all on campus, but they don't have to do anything because they're supposed to be studying for exams."}]}

Maybe one reason was that everyone felt like an immigrant. When I was a kid in Monroeville, people didn't call themselves American; they called themselves Italian, Serbian, or Ukrainian.

There is one more thing you need to be a startup hub, and Pittsburgh hasn't got it: investors. Silicon Valley has a big investor community because it's had 50 years to grow one. New York has a big investor community because it's full of people who like money a lot and are quick to notice new ways to get it. But Pittsburgh has neither of these.

So I would not bet on having a big investor community in the short term. But fortunately, there are three trends that make that less necessary than it used to be. One is that startups are increasingly cheap to start, so you just don't need as much outside money as you used to. The second is that, thanks to things like Kickstarter, a startup can get to revenue faster. You can put something on Kickstarter from anywhere. The third is programs like Y Combinator. A startup from anywhere in the world can go to YC for three months, pick up funding, and then return home if they want."}]}

And while it's impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something.

And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you. Things that lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at tricking you. An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online. When someone contradicts you, they're, in a sense, attacking youâsometimes pretty overtly. Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself. But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we now live in.

A few are lucky and realize early on that they love math, taking care of animals, or writing, and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can you determine if something is truly important or just a temporary distraction?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One heuristic for distinguishing what matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future.

And that is just what tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die. Their lives are short too. After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her. I lived as if she'd always be there. And in her typical quiet way, she encouraged that illusion. But an illusion it was.

I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at everyone's shoulder. Perhaps a better solution is to look at the problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do.

But the unconscious form is very widespread. I think because we grow up in a world where the pie fallacy is actually true, to kids, wealth is perceived as a fixed quantity that can be divided among people.

Creating wealth, as a source of economic inequality, is different from taking it â not just morally, but also practically, in the sense that it is harder to eradicate. One reason is that variation in productivity is accelerating. The rate at which individuals can create wealth depends on the technology available to them, and that grows exponentially.

Does it seem plausible that the people who currently go into finance to make their fortunes will continue to do so, but be content to work for ordinary salaries? The reason they go into finance is not because they love finance but because they want to get rich. If the only way left to get rich is to start startups, they'll start startups.

Ambitious people already move halfway around the world to further their careers, and startups can operate from anywhere nowadays.

However, the problem here is not simply economic inequality. There is an enormous difference in wealth between the household Larry Page grew up in and that of a successful startup founder, but that didn't prevent him from joining their ranks.

If all you have is statistics, it seems like that's what you need to fix. However, behind a broad statistical measure like economic inequality, there are factors that can be both positive and negative, some that are historical trends with immense momentum and others that are random accidents. If we want to address the issues behind the statistics, we must understand these complexities and focus our efforts where they'll do the most good."}]}

But it takes more than determination to create one of the hugely successful startups. Though most founders start out excited about the idea of getting rich, purely mercenary founders will usually take one of the big acquisition offers most successful startups get on the way up. The founders who go on to the next stage tend to be driven by a sense of mission. They have the same attachment to their companies that an artist or writer has to their work. However, it is very hard to predict at the outset which founders will do that. It's not simply a function of their initial attitude. Starting a company changes people."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does injustice play in perpetuating economic inequality and its effects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As well as problems that have economic inequality as a symptom, there are those that have it as a cause. But in most, if not all, cases, economic inequality is not the primary cause. There is usually some injustice that is allowing economic inequality to turn into other forms of inequality, and that injustice is what we need to fix. For example, the police in the US treat the poor worse than the rich. But the solution is not to make people richer; it's to make the police treat people more equitably. Otherwise, they'll continue to maltreat people who are weak in other ways."}]}

But that is exactly the point I'm making, though with sloppier language than I'd use to make it. The real problem is poverty, not economic inequality. And if you conflate them, you're aiming at the wrong target."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How have tax loopholes and economic inequality interacted throughout history?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Incidentally, tax loopholes are definitely not a product of some power shift due to recent increases in economic inequality. The golden age of economic equality in the mid-20th century was also the golden age of tax avoidance. Indeed, it was so widespread and so effective that I'm skeptical whether economic inequality was really so low then as we think. In a period when people are trying to hide wealth from the government, it will tend to be hidden from statistics too. One sign of the potential magnitude of the problem is the discrepancy between government receipts as a percentage of GDP, which have remained more or less constant during the entire period from the end of World War II to the present, and tax rates, which have varied dramatically."}]}

A lot of the change I've seen is fragmentation. US politics is much more polarized than it used to be. Culturally, we have ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful of happy cities, abandoning the rest. And increasing economic inequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too. I'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances of the same phenomenon. And moreover, that the cause is not some force that's pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces that had been pushing us together."}]}

Economically, it decreased variation in income. Like all modern armed forces, America's were socialist economically: from each according to his ability, to each according to his need, more or less. Higher-ranking members of the military got more (as higher-ranking members of socialist societies always do), but what they received was fixed according to their rank. The flattening effect wasn't limited to those under arms, because the US economy was conscripted too. Between 1942 and 1945, all wages were set by the National War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted to flatness. This national standardization of wages was so pervasive that its effects could still be seen years after the war ended."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the war impact social diversity among men and women from different backgrounds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Socially, the war tended to decrease variation. Over 16 million men and women from all sorts of different backgrounds were brought together in a way of life that was literally uniform. Service rates for men born in the early 1920s approached 80%. Working toward a common goal, often under stress, brought them still closer together."}]}

Wars make central governments more powerful, and World War II was an extreme case of this. In the U.S., as in all the other Allied countries, the federal government was slow to give up the new powers it had acquired. Indeed, in some respects, the war didn't end in 1945; the enemy just switched to the Soviet Union. In tax rates, federal power, defense spending, conscription, and nationalism, the decades after the war looked more like wartime than prewar peacetime."}]}

Here, there were three choices: NBC, CBS, and ABC, plus public TV for intellectuals and those with differing views. The programs that the three networks offered were indistinguishable. In fact, there was a triple pressure toward the center. If one show did try something daring, local affiliates in conservative markets would make them stop. Additionally, since televisions were expensive, whole families watched the same shows together, so they had to be suitable for everyone."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did mid-century TV culture influence societal perceptions and behavior, according to Robert MacNeil?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mid-century TV culture had both positive and negative influences on societal perceptions and behavior. On one hand, it presented a view of the world akin to that found in children's books, which likely encouraged better behavior, as parents hoped. However, like children's books, TV could also be misleadingâdangerously so for adults. In his autobiography, Robert MacNeil discusses witnessing gruesome images from Vietnam and reflects on the concern that such content could not be shown to families during dinner."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What personal experiences led the author to reject mainstream media at a young age?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I know how pervasive the common culture was because I tried to opt out of it, and it was practically impossible to find alternatives.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the author's observations about the lack of authenticity in various aspects of society?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But it wasn't just TV. It seemed like everything around me was crap.

Within companies, there were powerful forces pushing people toward a single model of how to look and act. IBM was particularly notorious for this, but they were only a little more extreme than other big companies. The models of how to look and act varied little between companies, meaning everyone within this world was expected to seem more or less the same. Not just those in the corporate world, but also everyone who aspired to it â which in the middle of the 20th century meant most people who weren't already in it. For most of the 20th century, working-class people tried hard to look middle class. You can see it in old photos; few adults aspired to look dangerous in 1950."}]}

In the mid-20th century, the corporations cut deals with the unions where they paid over market price for labor, partly because the unions were monopolies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why were large corporations willing to accept higher labor costs in the mid-20th century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Partly because, as components of oligopolies themselves, the corporations knew they could safely pass the cost on to their customers, because their competitors would have to as well. And partly because, in mid-century, most of the giant companies were still focused on finding new ways to milk economies of scale. Just as startups rightly pay AWS a premium over the cost of running their own servers so they can focus on growth, many of the big national corporations were willing to pay a premium for labor."}]}

But that same illiquidity also encouraged you not to seek it. If the company promised to employ you until you retired and give you a pension afterward, you didn't want to extract as much from it this year as you could. You needed to take care of the company so it could take care of you, especially when you'd been working with the same group of people for decades. If you tried to squeeze the company for more money, you were squeezing the organization that was going to take care of you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the perception of big companies as longstanding entities in the 20th century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By the 1970s, no one stopped to wonder where the big prestigious companies had come from in the first place. It seemed like they'd always been there, like the chemical elements. And indeed, there was a double wall between ambitious kids in the 20th century and the origins of the big companies. Many of the big companies were roll-ups that didn't have clear founders. And when they did, the founders didn't seem like us. Nearly all of them had been uneducated, in the sense of not having been to college. They were what Shakespeare called rude mechanicals. College trained one to be a member of the professional classes.

They increased from about 2% of the population in 1900 to about 25% in 2000. In the middle of the century, our two big forces intersected in the form of the GI Bill, which sent 2.2 million World War II veterans to college. Few thought of it in these terms, but the result of making college the canonical path for the ambitious was a world in which it was socially acceptable to work for Henry Ford, but not to be Henry Ford."}]}

When the Duplo economy started to disintegrate, it disintegrated in several different ways at once. Vertically integrated companies literally dis-integrated because it was more efficient to do so. Incumbents faced new competitors as (a) markets went global and (b) technical innovation started to trump economies of scale, turning size from an asset into a liability. Smaller companies were increasingly able to survive as formerly narrow channels to consumers broadened. Markets themselves started to change faster, as whole new categories of products appeared. Last but not least, the federal government, which had previously smiled upon J. P. Morgan's world as the natural state of things, began to realize it wasn't the last word after all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the approach to car manufacturing evolved from the time of Henry Ford to today?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Henry Ford's approach to car manufacturing was revolutionary for its time. He wanted to do everything himself, and the giant plant he built at River Rouge between 1917 and 1928 literally took in iron ore at one end and sent cars out the other. At its peak, 100,000 people worked there, and it seemed like the future of car manufacturing. However, that is not how car companies operate today. Now, much of the design and manufacturing happens in a long supply chain, with products that car companies ultimately assemble and sell. This approach works better because each company in the supply chain focuses on what they know best, and they must perform well or risk being replaced by another supplier."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to Henry Ford's preference for a single large company over a network of cooperating companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason Henry Ford preferred a single large company over a network of cooperating companies is that supplier networks take a while to evolve. In 1917, doing everything himself seemed to Ford the only way to achieve the scale he needed. Additionally, if you want to solve a problem using a network of cooperating companies, you have to be able to coordinate their efforts, which can be done much better with computers. Computers reduce the transaction costs that Coase argued are the raison d'Ãªtre of corporations. That is a fundamental change."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did perceptions of big companies' efficiency change from the early to the late 20th century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the early 20th century, big companies were synonymous with efficiency. In the late 20th century, they were synonymous with inefficiency. To some extent, this was because the companies themselves had become sclerotic. But it was also because our standards were higher."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the impact of deregulation on industries like air travel and long-distance phone service during the Carter administration?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gradually, the government realized that anti-competitive policies were doing more harm than good, and during the Carter administration, it started to remove them. The word used for this process was misleadingly narrow: deregulation. What was really happening was de-oligopolization. It happened to one industry after another. Two of the most visible to consumers were air travel and long-distance phone service, which both became dramatically cheaper after deregulation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did deregulation impact corporate management and mergers in the 1980s?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Deregulation also contributed to the wave of hostile takeovers in the 1980s. In the past, the only limit on the inefficiency of companies, short of actual bankruptcy, was the inefficiency of their competitors. Now, companies had to face absolute rather than relative standards. Any public company that didn't generate sufficient returns on its assets risked having its management replaced with one that would. Often, the new managers did this by breaking companies up into components that were more valuable separately."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the structure of the national economy evolve from Version 1 to Version 2?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Version 1 of the national economy consisted of a few big blocks whose relationships were negotiated in back rooms by a handful of executives, politicians, regulators, and labor leaders. Version 2 was higher resolution: there were more companies of more different sizes making more different things, and their relationships changed faster. In this world, there were still plenty of backroom negotiations, but more was left to market forces, which further accelerated the fragmentation."}]}

There was a lot of change in a few decades, and what we ended up with was qualitatively different. The companies in the S&P 500 in 1958 had been there an average of 61 years.

To what extent were computers a precondition? It would take a book to answer that. Obviously, the spread of computing power was a precondition for the rise of startups. I suspect it was for most of what happened in finance too. But was it a precondition for globalization or the LBO wave? I don't know, but I wouldn't discount the possibility. It may be that the refragmentation was driven by computers in the way the industrial revolution was driven by steam engines. Whether or not computers were a precondition, they have certainly accelerated it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the evolving nature of companies impacted career perceptions and salary structures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The evolving nature of companies has changed people's relationships with their employers. Why climb a corporate ladder that might be yanked out from under you? Ambitious individuals have started to think of a career less as climbing a single ladder than as a series of jobs that might be at different companies. More movement (or even potential movement) between companies has introduced more competition in salaries. Additionally, as companies have become smaller, it has become easier to estimate how much an employee contributes to the company's revenue. Both changes have driven salaries toward market price. Since people vary dramatically in productivity, paying market price has meant salaries started to diverge."}]}

That word is not much used now because the phenomenon it describes is so taken for granted, but at the time, it was a label for something novel. Yuppies were young professionals who made lots of money. To someone in their twenties today, this wouldn't seem worth naming. Why wouldn't young professionals make lots of money? But until the 1980s, being underpaid early in your career was part of what it meant to be a professional. Young professionals were paying their dues, working their way up the ladder. The rewards would come later. What was novel about yuppies was that they wanted market price for the work they were doing now."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential consequences of widespread underpayment for entry-level positions in the job market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Underpaying people at the beginning of their careers only works if everyone does it. Once some employer breaks ranks, everyone else has to, or they can't get good people. Once this process starts, it spreads through the whole economy because, at the beginnings of people's careers, they can easily switch not merely employers but industries."}]}

As in the past, there were multiple ways to do it. Some made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playing zero-sum games. But once it became possible to make one's fortune, the ambitious had to decide whether or not to. A physicist who chose physics over Wall Street in 1990 was making a sacrifice that a physicist in 1960 didn't have to think about."}]}

As big companies' oligopolies became less secure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thus less willing to overpay for labor. As the Duplo world of a few big blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes â some of them overseas â it became harder for unions to enforce their monopolies. As a result, workers' wages also tended toward market price, which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended to be lower. Perhaps dramatically so, if automation had decreased the need for some kind of work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the breakup of the mid-century model influence social behaviors and lifestyle choices?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Just as the mid-century model induced social as well as economic cohesion, its breakup brought social as well as economic fragmentation. People started to dress and act differently. Those who would later be called the \"creative class\" became more mobile. People who didn't care much for religion felt less pressure to go to church for appearances' sake, while those who liked it a lot opted for increasingly colorful forms. Some switched from meatloaf to tofu, and others to Hot Pockets. Some switched from driving Ford sedans to driving small imported cars, and others to driving SUVs. Kids who went to private schools or wished they did started to dress \"preppy,\" and kids who wanted to seem rebellious made a conscious effort to look disreputable. In a hundred ways, people spread apart."}]}

In the 20th century, cohesion occurred somewhat naturally, as the wars were primarily due to external forces, and the economy was in an evolutionary phase. Today, if we want cohesion, it must be induced deliberately, and it's not obvious how to achieve that. I suspect the best we can do is address the symptoms of fragmentation, but that may be enough."}]}

The unusual conditions that prevailed in the mid-20th century masked this underlying trend. The ambitious had little choice but to join large organizations that made them march in step with lots of other people â literally in the case of the armed forces, figuratively in the case of big corporations. Even if the big corporations had wanted to pay people proportionate to their value, they couldn't have figured out how. But that constraint has gone now. Ever since it started to erode in the 1970s, we've seen the underlying forces at work again."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the underlying factors contributing to economic inequality despite efforts to mitigate it through subsidies and taxes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As long as it's possible to get rich by creating wealth, the default tendency will be for economic inequality to increase. Even if you eliminate all the other ways to get rich, you can mitigate this with subsidies at the bottom and taxes at the top. However, unless taxes are high enough to discourage people from creating wealth, you're always going to be fighting a losing battle against increasing variation in productivity."}]}

Or rather, back to stay. Nothing is forever, but the tendency toward fragmentation should be more forever than most things, precisely because it's not due to any particular cause.

If we think 20th-century cohesion disappeared because of a few policy tweaks, we'll be deluded into thinking we can get it back (minus the bad parts, somehow) with a few counter-tweaks.

Basically, the same differentials exist to this day, thirty years later.\" However, Goldin and Margo think market forces in the postwar period also helped preserve the wartime compression of wages â specifically, increased demand for unskilled workers and an oversupply of educated ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the American practice of employer-paid health insurance originate in relation to wage controls?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The American custom of having employers pay for health insurance derives from efforts by businesses to circumvent NWLB wage controls in order to attract workers."}]}

There were lots of exemptions, especially for individuals. During World War II, the tax codes were so new that the government had little acquired immunity to tax avoidance. If the rich paid high taxes during the war, it was more because they wanted to than because they had to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How have federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP changed since the war, and what does the data suggest about the impact of tax rates on actual payments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "After the war, federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP were about the same as they are now. In fact, for the entire period since the war, tax receipts have stayed close to 18% of GDP, despite dramatic changes in tax rates. The lowest point occurred when marginal income tax rates were highest: 14.1% in 1950. Looking at the data, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that tax rates have had little effect on what people actually paid."}]}

In many ways, the New Deal was a sort of dress rehearsal for the measures the federal government took during wartime. The wartime versions were much more drastic and more pervasive, though. As Anthony Badger wrote, \"for many Americans the decisive change in their experiences came not with the New Deal but with World War II.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What potential factor could be linked to the origins of the world wars according to the speaker?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't know enough about the origins of the world wars to say, but it's not inconceivable that they were connected to the rise of big corporations. If that were the case, 20th-century cohesion would have a single cause."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two distinct economic groups described in Galbraith's analysis of the bimodal economy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "More precisely, there was a bimodal economy consisting, in Galbraith's words, of \"the world of the technically dynamic, massively capitalized, and highly organized corporations on the one hand and the hundreds of thousands of small and traditional proprietors on the other.\" Money, prestige, and power were concentrated in the former, and there was near-zero crossover."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can unions benefit the companies they represent in terms of political support?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The relationships between unions and unionized companies can even be symbiotic because unions will exert political pressure to protect their hosts. According to Michael Lind, when politicians tried to attack the A&P supermarket chain because it was putting local grocery stores out of business, \"A&P successfully defended itself by allowing the unionization of its workforce in 1938, thereby gaining organized labor as a constituency.\" I've seen this phenomenon myself: hotel unions are responsible for more of the political pressure against Airbnb than hotel companies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What did Galbraith find surprising about the motivations of corporate executives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Galbraith was clearly puzzled that corporate executives would work so hard to make money for other people (the shareholders) instead of for themselves. He devoted much of his analysis to understanding this phenomenon."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors might influence modern corporate executives' motivations beyond financial rewards?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "His theory was that professionalism had replaced money as a motive, and that modern corporate executives were, like (good) scientists, motivated less by financial rewards than by the desire to do good work and thereby earn the respect of their peers. There is something in this, though I think lack of movement between companies combined with self-interest explains much of the observed behavior."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does Galbraith's 1952 study reveal about the tenure of the highest paid executives at major corporations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Galbraith (p. 94) states that a 1952 study of the 800 highest-paid executives at 300 big corporations found that three-quarters of them had been with their company for more than 20 years."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the relatively low executive salaries in the early 20th century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems likely that in the first third of the 20th century, executive salaries were low partly because companies were more dependent on banks, who would have disapproved if executives received too much. This was certainly true in the beginning. The first big company CEOs were J. P. Morgan's hired hands."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When did companies begin to finance themselves with retained earnings instead of relying on bank capital?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Companies didn't start to finance themselves with retained earnings until the 1920s. Until then, they had to pay out their earnings in dividends and depended on banks for capital for expansion. Bankers continued to sit on corporate boards until the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did financial controls during World War II influence executive salaries and employee mobility in big companies by mid-century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By mid-century, big companies funded three-quarters of their growth from earnings. However, the early years of bank dependence, reinforced by the financial controls of World War II, must have had a significant effect on social conventions regarding executive salaries. Therefore, it may be that the lack of movement between companies was as much the effect of low salaries as the cause."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What financial strategy in the 1920s contributed to the 1929 stock market crash?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The switch in the 1920s to financing growth with retained earnings was one cause of the 1929 crash. The banks now had to find someone else to lend to, so they made more margin loans."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the societal perception of founders and entrepreneurship when the author was a child?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Founders weren't celebrated in the press when I was a kid. \"Our founder\" meant a photograph of a severe-looking man with a walrus mustache and a wing collar who had died decades ago. The thing to be when I was a kid was an entrepreneur."}]}

I don't know enough about big companies to say. But it is certainly not impossible for a CEO to make 200 times as much difference to a company's revenues as the average employee. Look at what Steve Jobs did for Apple when he came back as CEO. It would have been a good deal for the board to give him 95% of the company. Apple's market cap the day Steve came back in July 1997 was 1.73 billion. Five percent of Apple now (January 2016) would be worth about 30 billion. And it would not be if Steve hadn't come back; Apple probably wouldn't even exist anymore."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes social upheaval from fragmentation in the context of the late 1960s?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The late 1960s were famous for social upheaval. However, that was more rebellion (which can happen in any era if people are provoked sufficiently) than fragmentation. You do not see fragmentation unless you see people breaking off to both the left and right."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the primary methods through which individuals built wealth in the mid 20th century despite high taxes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There were a handful of ways to make a fortune in the mid-20th century. The main one was drilling for oil, which was open to newcomers because it was not something big companies could dominate through economies of scale. How did individuals accumulate large fortunes in an era of such high taxes? Giant tax loopholes defended by two of the most powerful men in Congress, Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who were the founders of YC and what roles did they play in its operations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "YC had four founders.

Jessica and I ran YC day-to-day, and Robert and Trevor read applications and did interviews with us."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role did Jessica play in shaping the culture at Y Combinator, and why was this culture significant?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Early YC was a family, and Jessica was its mom. The culture she defined was one of YC's most important innovations. Culture is important in any organization, but at YC, culture wasn't just how we behaved when we built the product; at YC, the culture was the product."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the founders of YC integrate their personal lives with their work before having children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Before we had kids, YC was more or less our life. There was no real distinction between working hours and not. We talked about YC all the time. And while there might be some businesses that it would be tedious to let infect your private life, we liked it. We started YC because it was something we were interested in. And some of the problems we were trying to solve were endlessly difficult. How do you recognize good founders? You could talk about that for years, and we did; we still do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities make Jessica a valuable asset in evaluating startup founders at Y Combinator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jessica is better at some things than I am, and I'm better at some things than she is. One of the things she is best at is judging people. She is one of those rare individuals with x-ray vision for character. She can see through any kind of faker almost immediately. Her nickname within YC was the Social Radar, and this special power of hers was critical in making YC what it is. The earlier you pick startups, the more you're picking the founders. Later-stage investors get to try products and look at growth numbers. At the stage where YC invests, there is often neither a product nor any numbers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the key factor behind Y Combinator's success in selecting startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Others thought YC had some special insight about the future of technology. Mostly, we had the same sort of insight Socrates claimed: we at least knew we knew nothing. What made YC successful was being able to pick good founders. We thought Airbnb was a bad idea; we funded it because we liked the founders."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Jessica's role during the interviews differ from that of Robert and Trevor?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "During interviews, Robert, Trevor, and I would pepper the applicants with technical questions. Jessica would mostly watch. A lot of the applicants probably read her as some kind of secretary, especially early on, because she was the one who'd go out and get each new group, and she didn't ask many questions. She was okay with that. It was easier for her to watch people if they didn't notice her. But after the interview, the three of us would turn to Jessica and ask, \"What does the Social Radar say?\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the use of the Social Radar influence the selection process for founders at interviews?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Having the Social Radar at interviews wasn't just how we picked founders who would be successful; it was also how we picked founders who were good people. At first, we did this because we couldn't help it. Imagine what it would feel like to have x-ray vision for character. Being around bad people would be intolerable. So, we would refuse to fund founders whose characters we had doubts about, even if we thought they would be successful."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unforeseen benefits arose from the initial selection process for YC's founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Though we initially did this out of self-indulgence, it turned out to be very valuable to YC. We didn't realize it in the beginning, but the people we were picking would become the YC alumni network. And once we picked them, unless they did something really egregious, they were going to be part of it for life. Some now think YC's alumni network is its most valuable feature. I personally think YC's advice is pretty good too, but the alumni network is certainly among the most valuable features. The level of trust and helpfulness is remarkable for a group of such size. And Jessica is the main reason why."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is Jessica's significant role at YC not widely recognized?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If Jessica was so important to YC, why don't more people realize it? Partly because I'm a writer, and writers always get disproportionate attention. YC's brand was initially my brand, and our applicants were people who'd read my essays. But there is another reason: Jessica hates attention. Talking to reporters makes her nervous. The thought of giving a talk paralyzes her. She was even uncomfortable at our wedding because the bride is always the center of attention."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why does she dislike attention in social situations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not just because she's shy that she hates attention, but because it throws off the social radar. She can't be herself. You can't watch people when everyone is watching you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are her feelings about public attention and how does it relate to her views on modesty?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another reason attention worries her is that she hates bragging. In anything she does that is publicly visible, her biggest fear (after the obvious fear that it will be bad) is that it will seem ostentatious. She says being too modest is a common problem for women. But in her case, it goes beyond that. She has a horror of ostentation so visceral it's almost a phobia."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might someone struggle in a leadership role that involves public representation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "She also hates fighting. She can't do it; she just shuts down. Unfortunately, there is a good deal of fighting in being the public face of an organization."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role did Jessica play in the founding and development of Y Combinator that is often overlooked in its history?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Although Jessica played a crucial role in making Y Combinator unique, the very qualities that enabled her to do so mean she tends to be overlooked in YC's history. Many people subscribe to the narrative that Paul Graham started YC and that his wife merely assisted him. Even critics of YC often perpetuate this story. A couple of years ago, when we faced criticism for not funding more female founders, the narrative treated YC as synonymous with Paul Graham. Acknowledging Jessica's central role would have complicated that narrative."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did she choose not to publicly respond to the criticisms surrounding female founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "She chose not to publicly respond to the criticisms surrounding female founders due to the company of sexism. I've never seen her angrier about anything. But she did not contradict them. Not publicly. In private, there was a great deal of profanity. She wrote three separate essays about the question of female founders, but she could never bring herself to publish any of them. She'd seen the level of vitriol in this debate, and she shrank from engaging."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the reasons behind her aversion to engaging in conflicts, particularly with dishonest individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It wasn't just because she disliked fighting; she is so sensitive to character that it repels her even to fight with dishonest people. The idea of mixing it up with linkbait journalists or Twitter trolls seems to her not merely frightening, but disgusting."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Jessica's experience with media coverage reflect the challenges faced by female founders in gaining recognition for their professional achievements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But Jessica knew her example as a successful female founder would encourage more women to start companies, so last year she did something YC had never done before and hired a PR firm to get her some interviews. At one of the first she did, the reporter brushed aside her insights about startups and turned it into a sensationalistic story about how some guy had tried to chat her up as she was waiting outside the bar where they had arranged to meet. Jessica was mortified, partly because the guy had done nothing wrong, but more because the story treated her as a victim significant only for being a woman, rather than one of the most knowledgeable investors in the Valley."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Jessica contribute to the development and identity of YC?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jessica contributed to the development and identity of YC by curating and nurturing a diverse collection of people. YC is fundamentally a nexus of individuals, much like a university; it doesn't make a product. What defines it is the people, and Jessica, more than anyone, played a crucial role in shaping that community. In that sense, she literally made YC."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors are the best predictors of startup success according to Jessica's research?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jessica knows more about the qualities of startup founders than anyone else ever has. Her immense data set and x-ray vision are the perfect storm in that respect. The qualities of the founders are the best predictor of how a startup will do. Startups are, in turn, the most important source of growth in mature economies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What skills did she possess that helped her identify issues within the team?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "She was always good at sniffing out any red flags about the team or their determination and disarmingly asking the right questions, which usually revealed more than the founders realized."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the desire for recognition affect one's comfort with public scrutiny?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While she likes getting attention in the sense of receiving credit for what she has done, she doesn't like getting attention in the sense of being watched in real time. Unfortunately, not just for her but for a lot of people, how much you get of the former depends a lot on how much you get of the latter."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Jessica's behavior at public events contradict her feelings about attention?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you saw Jessica at a public event, you would never guess she hates attention, because (a) she is very polite and (b) when she's nervous, she expresses it by smiling more."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact does incivility in conversations have on the willingness of thoughtful individuals, like Jessica, to engage in discussions about sensitive topics?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a sort of Gresham's Law of conversations. If a conversation reaches a certain level of incivility, the more thoughtful people start to leave. No one understands female founders better than Jessica. But it's unlikely anyone will ever hear her speak candidly about the topic. She ventured a toe in that water a while ago, and the reaction was so violent that she decided, \"never again.\""}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean for a selection process to be biased against certain applicants?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What does it mean for a selection process to be biased against certain applicants? Think about what it means to be biased. What it means for a selection process to be biased against applicants of type x is that it's harder for them to make it through. This means applicants of type x have to be better to get selected than applicants not of type x."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can performance testing be used to identify bias in a selection process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course, the test you use to measure performance must be a valid one. In particular, it must not be invalidated by the bias you're trying to measure. However, there are some domains where performance can be measured, and in those, detecting bias is straightforward. Want to know if the selection process was biased against some type of applicant? Check whether they outperform the others. This is not just a heuristic for detecting bias; it's what bias means."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the anticipated increase in the use of a specific technique in future studies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I predict we'll see this technique used more in the future. The information needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available. Data about who applies for things is usually closely guarded by the organizations selecting them, but nowadays, data about who gets selected is often publicly available to anyone who takes the trouble to aggregate it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What issue arises when selection criteria differ for various types of applicants?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This technique wouldn't work if the selection process looked for different things from different types of applicants; for example, if an employer hired men based on their ability but women based on their appearance."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did First Round exclude Uber from their study on startup investment returns?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As Paul Buchheit points out, First Round excluded their most successful investment, Uber, from the study. While it makes sense to exclude outliers from some types of studies, studies of returns from startup investing, which is all about hitting outliers, are not one of them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often use different language styles when writing compared to speaking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Something comes over most people when they start writing. They write in a different language than they'd use if they were talking to a friend. The sentence structure and even the words are different. No one uses \"pen\" as a verb in spoken English. You'd feel like an idiot using \"pen\" instead of \"write\" in a conversation with a friend."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to simplify written language for effective communication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you want people to read and understand what you write, simplifying written language is important. Written language is more complex, which makes it more work to read. It's also more formal and distant, which gives the reader's attention permission to drift. But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentences and fancy words give you, the writer, the false impression that you're saying more than you actually are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do experts communicate complex ideas in their fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You don't need complex sentences to express complex ideas. When specialists in some abstruse topic talk to one another about ideas in their field, they don't use sentences any more complex than they do when talking about what to have for lunch. They use different words, certainly, but even those they use no more than necessary. In my experience, the harder the subject, the more informally experts speak. Partly, I think, because they have less to prove, and partly because the harder the ideas you're talking about, the less you can afford to let language get in the way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "In what contexts might writers choose to use complex language or poetic forms instead of straightforward communication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not saying spoken language always works best. Poetry is as much music as text, so you can say things you wouldn't say in conversation. There are a handful of writers who can get away with using fancy language in prose. Of course, there are cases where writers don't want to make it easy to understand what they're sayingâin corporate announcements of bad news, for example, or at the more complex levels of literary expression."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can you improve your writing to sound more conversational?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems to be hard for most people to write in spoken language. So perhaps the best solution is to write your first draft the way you usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and ask, \"Is this the way I'd say this if I were talking to a friend?\" If it isn't, imagine what you would say and use that instead. After a while, this filter will start to operate as you write. When you write something you wouldn't say, you'll hear the clank as it hits the page."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What steps do you take to ensure your essays sound conversational before publishing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Before I publish a new essay, I read it out loud and fix everything that doesn't sound like conversation. I even fix bits that are phonetically awkward; I don't know if that's necessary, but it doesn't cost much."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a recommended method for improving writing that feels disconnected from natural spoken language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This trick may not always be enough. I've seen writing so far removed from spoken language that it couldn't be fixed sentence by sentence. For cases like that, there's a more drastic solution. After writing the first draft, try explaining to a friend what you just wrote. Then replace the draft with what you said to your friend."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do many people struggle to write in a way that reflects their natural spoken language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People often tell me how much my essays sound like me talking. The fact that this seems worthy of comment shows how rarely people manage to write in spoken language. Otherwise, everyone's writing would sound like them talking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is one effective strategy to improve writing and connect with readers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you simply manage to write in spoken language, you'll be ahead of 95% of writers.

Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth is what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to profitability on the money they have left? Or, to put it more dramatically, by default, do they live or die?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do many startup founders struggle to assess about their company's viability?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to determine if a startup is default alive or default dead before discussing its future?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive or default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the answer. If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious new things they could do. If it's default dead, we probably need to talk about how to save it. We know the current trajectory ends badly. How can they get off that trajectory?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for founders to understand whether their startup is default alive or default dead as the company matures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default dead? Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that. It's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than it makes sense to ask a 3-year-old how he plans to support himself. But as the company grows older, the question switches from meaningless to critical. That kind of switch often takes people by surprise."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When is the right time to assess whether a project is on track or at risk of failure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too late whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too early. It's hard to say precisely when the question switches polarity. But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to start worrying too late."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key factors that lead founders to face a fatal pinch in their startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fatal pinch is default dead, slow growth, and not enough time to fix it. The way founders end up in it is by not realizing that's where they're headed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do founders often neglect to consider their financial sustainability?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're default alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise more money.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can acknowledging the harsh realities of a situation help in preventing future crises?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Acknowledging the harsh realities of a situation can help separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinking of the future with vague optimism, it is important to explicitly separate the components. For example, one might say, \"We're default dead, but we're counting on investors to save us.\" As you articulate this, it may trigger the same alarms in your head that it does in mine. If you set off those alarms sufficiently early, you may be able to avoid the fatal pinch."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for businesses to have a backup plan for fundraising?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is important for businesses to have a backup plan for fundraising because investors can be fickle, and you can never rely solely on them. Sometimes, something about your business may spook investors, even if your growth is strong. Therefore, no matter how good your growth is, you should never treat fundraising as more than a plan A. You should always have a plan B as well: you should know (and write down) precisely what you'll need to do to survive if you can't raise more money, and exactly when you'll have to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to a startup's growth rate beyond its spending habits?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the sharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be. In practice, there is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends and how fast it grows. When a startup grows fast, it's usually because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of addressing some big need directly. When a startup spends a lot, it's usually because the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because they're wasteful."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is one of the biggest mistakes startups make that can lead to their failure after raising funds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the biggest mistakes startups make that can lead to their failure after raising funds is hiring too fast. If you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just how to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead. Hiring too fast is by far the biggest killer of startups that raise money."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do founders often overestimate the need to hire more employees for their startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow. But most err on the side of overestimating this need rather than underestimating it. Why? Partly because there's so much work to do. Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough people, it will all get done. Partly because successful startups have lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one does in order to be successful. In fact, the large staffs of successful startups are probably more the effect of growth than the cause. And partly because when founders have slow growth, they don't want to face what is usually the real reason: the product is not appealing enough."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the differing incentives between founders and venture capitalists after a funding round?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Founders who've just raised money are often encouraged to overhire by the VCs who funded them. Kill-or-cure strategies are optimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect. VCs want to blow you up, in one sense of the phrase or the other. But as a founder, your incentives are different. You want, above all, to survive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are common pitfalls that lead to the failure of startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's a common way startups die. They make something moderately appealing and have decent initial growth. They raise their first round fairly easily because the founders seem smart and the idea sounds plausible. But because the product is only moderately appealing, growth is okay but not great. The founders convince themselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to boost growth. Their investors agree. But, because the product is only moderately appealing, the growth never comes. Now they're rapidly running out of runway. They hope further investment will save them. But because they have high expenses and slow growth, they're now unappealing to investors. They're unable to raise more, and the company dies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a more effective strategy for improving a product's appeal in its early stages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem: that the product is only moderately appealing. Hiring people is rarely the way to fix that. More often than not, it makes it harder. At this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be \"built out,\" and that's usually easier with fewer people."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some effective strategies for growth that founders can pursue for their startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Effective strategies for growth that founders can pursue for their startups include focusing on customer feedback, leveraging data analytics, or redesigning the product in the way only founders can. For many, if not most, startups, these paths to growth will be the ones that actually work."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does usage growth impact revenue predictions and investor perceptions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Steep usage growth will also interest investors.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What issues can arise from premature scaling in a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A related problem that I see a lot is premature scalingâfounders take a small business that isn't really working (bad unit economics, typically) and then scale it up because they want impressive growth numbers. This is similar to over-hiring in that it makes the business much harder to fix once it's big, plus they are bleeding cash really fast."}]}

That means two years later you'll be making $80k a month instead of $160k. How far behind are you? How long will it take to catch up with where you'd have been if you were extracting every penny? A mere 15 weeks. After two years, the un-rapacious founder is only 3.5 months behind the rapacious one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does a slightly lower extraction rate but higher growth rate impact long-term revenue compared to a more aggressive approach?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Suppose, as before, that you only extract half as much from users as you could, but that you're able to grow 6% a week instead of 5%. Now how are you doing compared to the rapacious founder after two years? You're already aheadâ$214k a month versus $160kâand pulling away fast.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is being overly aggressive not beneficial for the success of startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One case where it would help to be rapacious is when growth depends on that. What makes startups different is that usually it doesn't. Startups usually win by making something so great that people recommend it to their friends. Being rapacious not only doesn't help you do that, but probably hurts."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset can founders adopt to balance kindness and business success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're a founder, here's a deal you can make with yourself that will both make you happy and make your company successful. Tell yourself you can be as nice as you want, so long as you work hard on your growth rate to compensate. Most successful startups make that trade-off unconsciously. Maybe if you do it consciously, you'll do it even better."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates the most successful startup founders if not financial gain?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many think successful startup founders are driven by money. In fact, the secret weapon of the most successful founders is that they aren't. If they were, they'd have taken one of the acquisition offers that every fast-growing startup gets on the way up. What drives the most successful founders is the same thing that drives most people who make things: the company is their project."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the common reasons for startups failing to secure additional funding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From running through their initial funding and then being unable to raise more, the underlying cause is usually slow growth or excessive spending rather than insufficient effort to extract money from existing customers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens when you realize there are alternative identities or labels beyond the one you currently hold?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Once you acknowledge that, you stop believing there is nothing else you could be called.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What evidence suggests that naming companies is a unique skill in startup development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason I know that naming companies is a distinct skill orthogonal to the others you need in a startup is that I happen to have it. Back when I was running YC and did more office hours with startups, I would often help them find new names. Eighty percent of the time, we could find at least one good name in a 20-minute office hour slot."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is one common mistake that startups should address quickly to increase their chances of success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One common mistake that startups should address quickly to increase their chances of success is neglecting to secure a suitable domain name. There are, of course, examples of startups that have succeeded without having the .com of their name. There are startups that have succeeded despite any number of different mistakes.

A wimpy little single-board computer for hobbyists that used a TV as a monitor? A new search engine, when there were already about 10, and they were all trying to de-emphasize search?

It was by being benevolent that Ronco became so powerful. All the deals he gets to invest in come to him through referrals. Google did. Facebook did. Twitter was a referral from Evan Williams himself. And the reason so many people refer deals to him is that he's proven himself to be a good guy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean to be good in the context of dealing with someone like Ronco?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good does not mean being a pushover.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does unpredictability in the startup world influence interpersonal behavior and relationships?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The effect of unpredictability is more subtle. It increases the work of being inconsistent. If you're going to be two-faced, you have to know who you should be nice to and who you can get away with being nasty to. In the startup world, things change so rapidly that you can't tell. The random college kid you talk to today might, in a couple of years, be the CEO of the hottest startup in the Valley. If you can't tell who to be nice to, you have to be nice to everyone. And probably the only people who can manage that are the people who are genuinely good."}]}

For example, a lot of programmers I know, including me, actually like debugging. It's not something people tend to volunteer; one likes it the way one likes popping zits.

In practice, that means startups should only talk to corp dev when they're either doing really well or really badly. If you're doing really badly, meaning the company is about to die, you may as well talk to them because you have nothing to lose. And if you're doing really well, you can safely talk to them because you both know the price will have to be high, and if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you'll be confident enough to tell them to get lost."}]}

Corp dev people's whole job is to buy companies, and they don't even get to choose which. The only way their performance is measured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitious ones will stop at nothing to achieve that. For example, they'll almost always start with a lowball offer just to see if you'll take it. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you and make you easier to manipulate."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unethical tactics do corporate development professionals often use during negotiations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most innocent tactics used by corporate development professionals is to agree on a price, making you think you have a done deal, only for them to come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won't do it for more than half the agreed-upon price. This happens all the time. If you think investors can behave badly, it's nothing compared to what corporate development people can do, even those at companies that are otherwise benevolent."}]}

So they claim it's because they want to drive down salaries. But if you talk to startups, you find practically every one over a certain size has gone through legal contortions to get programmers into the US, where they then paid them the same as they'd have paid an American.

I realize that's strong language, but the people dithering about this don't seem to understand the power of the forces at work here. Technology gives the best programmers huge leverage.

This doesn't mean a great programmer is infinitely more valuable, because any invention has a finite market value. However, it's easy to imagine cases where a great programmer might create innovations worth 100 times or even 1000 times an average programmer's salary.

I spent almost a decade investing in early-stage startups, and curiously enough, protecting yourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do to succeed as a startup investor. Most really good startup ideas look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically because some change in the world just switched them from bad to good. I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and the techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general."}]}

It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so rarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively open-minded. Instead of trying to point yourself in the right direction, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and try instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to maintain flexibility in your working hypotheses?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's okay to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain you a bit, because they also motivate you.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates startup investors to challenge outdated beliefs about potential investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correcting obsolete beliefs. If they can realize before other investors that some apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a huge amount of money. But the incentives are more than just financial. Investors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them, and they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn whether they guessed right. The investors who say no to a Google (and there were several) will remember it for the rest of their lives."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can turning comments into bets influence the accuracy of one's ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Anyone who must, in some sense, bet on ideas rather than merely commenting on them has similar incentives. This means anyone who wants such incentives can have them by turning their comments into bets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public form, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right than most people would in a casual conversation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one guard against outdated beliefs in the face of unpredictable future discoveries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs is to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Though the nature of future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predict quite well what sort of people will make them. Good new ideas come from earnest, energetic, and independent-minded people."}]}

So we suspended disbelief and funded them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can surrounding yourself with innovative individuals help you stay aware of the obsolescence of your beliefs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This too seems a technique that should be generally applicable.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you be cautious about when your hypotheses become associated with your identity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You should be cautious when your hypotheses become associated with your identity, especially if they become well-known enough that people start to identify them with you. You have to be extra skeptical about things you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be identified with you, it will almost certainly start to fall into that category."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria determine whether someone is considered \"sufficiently expert\" in a field?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In practice, \"sufficiently expert\" doesn't require one to be recognized as an expertâwhich is a trailing indicator in any case.

The same book would get compiled differently at different points in your life, which means it is very much worth reading important books multiple times. I always used to feel some misgivings about rereading books; I unconsciously lumped reading together with work like carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you did it wrong the first time.

When people do that today, it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g., when looking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in their compiled code (e.g., when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering the childhood trauma that prevented him from singing). But as technologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it may become common for people to relive experiences without any goal in mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading a book."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do startups face when they have limited runway despite having funds in the bank?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many startups go through a point a few months before they die where, although they have a significant amount of money in the bank, they're also losing a lot each month, and revenue growth is either nonexistent or mediocre.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the impact of overestimating fundraising opportunities on a startup's path to profitability?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the things that makes the fatal pinch so dangerous is that it's self-reinforcing. Founders overestimate their chances of raising more money, and so are slack about reaching profitability, which further decreases their chances of raising money."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can startup founders prevent falling into the trap of the fatal pinch when raising funds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now that you know about the fatal pinch, how do you avoid it?

The self-reinforcing nature of this situation works the other way too: the less you need further investment, the easier it is to get."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When is it advisable to consider shutting down a company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You should shut down the company if you're certain it will fail no matter what you do.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When is it appropriate to make the decision to fire an employee?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Deciding to fire people is usually hard, but there's one case in which it shouldn't be: when there are people you already know you should fire but you're in denial about it. If so, now's the time."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential drawbacks of cutting salaries as a solution to financial issues in a company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cutting salaries as a solution to financial issues in a company is a weak approach that will only work when the problem isn't too severe. If your current trajectory won't quite get you to profitability but you can get over the threshold by cutting salaries a little, you might be able to make the case to everyone for doing it. Otherwise, you're probably just postponing the problem, and that will be obvious to the people whose salaries you're proposing to cut."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should a company do if it realizes it has overhired before establishing a clear direction for its product?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You should lean more toward firing people if the source of your trouble is overhiring. If you went out and hired 15 people before you even knew what you were building, you've created a broken company. You need to figure out what you're building, and it will probably be easier to do that with a handful of people than with 15. Plus, those 15 people might not even be the ones you need for whatever you end up building. So the solution may be to shrink and then figure out what direction to grow in. After all, you're not doing those 15 people any favors if you fly the company into the ground with them aboard. They'll all lose their jobs eventually, along with all the time they expended on this doomed company."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy should a startup with a small team consider to improve its revenue generation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you only have a handful of people, it may be better to focus on trying to make more money. It may seem facile to suggest a startup make more money, as if that could be done for the asking. Usually, a startup is already trying as hard as it can to sell whatever it sells. What I'm suggesting here is not so much to try harder to make money but to try to make money in a different way. For example, if you have only one person selling while the rest are writing code, consider having everyone work on selling. What good will more code do you when you're out of business? If you have to write code to close a certain deal, go ahead; that follows from everyone working on selling. But only work on whatever will get you the most revenue the soonest."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can startups leverage their expertise to generate revenue beyond traditional product sales?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another way to make money differently is to sell different things, and in particular, to do more consulting work. I say \"consulting\" because there is a long slippery slope from making products to pure consulting, and you don't have to go far down it before you start to offer something really attractive to customers. Although your product may not be very appealing yet, if you're a startup, your programmers will often be way better than the ones your customers have. Or you may have expertise in some new field they don't understand. So if you change your sales conversations just a little from \"Do you want to buy our product?\" to \"What do you need that you'd pay a lot for?\" you may find it's suddenly a lot easier to extract money from customers."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do consultants face due to the high demand for custom work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is usually so much demand for custom work that, unless you're really incompetent, there has to be some point down the slope of consulting at which you can survive. But I didn't use the term slippery slope by accident; customers' insatiable demand for custom work will always be pushing you toward the bottom. So while you'll probably survive, the problem now becomes to survive with the least damage and distraction."}]}

For these companies, substitute \"progress\" for \"revenue growth.\" You're not one of these companies unless your initial investors agreed in advance that you were. And frankly, even these companies wish they weren't, because the illiquidity of \"progress\" puts them at the mercy of investors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should a startup do if they have 8 months of runway or less and are unsure about their fundraising prospects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you have 8 months of runway or less and are unsure about your fundraising prospects, the best approach is to seek funding immediately. There's a variant of the fatal pinch where your existing investors help you along by promising to invest more, or rather, where you read them as promising to invest more while they think they're just mentioning the possibility. By trying to secure the money right now, you'll either receive the funds, which solves the immediate problem, or at least prevent your investors from helping you remain in denial about your fundraising prospects."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why does the author believe that engaging in fights is unproductive?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think there are several reasons. One is that being mean makes you stupid. That's why I hate fights. You never do your best work in a fight because fights are not sufficiently general. Winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved. You don't win fights by thinking of big ideas but by thinking of tricks that work in one particular case. And yet fighting is just as much work as thinking about real problems, which is particularly painful to someone who cares how their brain is used: your brain goes fast, but you get nowhere, like a car spinning its wheels."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do successful startups typically achieve victory in their industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups don't win by attacking; they win by transcending.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do mean founders struggle to build successful teams?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another reason mean founders lose is that they can't get the best people to work for them. They can hire people who will put up with them because they need a job. However, the best people have other options. A mean person can't convince the best people to work for him unless he is super convincing. While having the best people helps any organization, it's critical for startups."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the concept of success evolved in relation to resource control throughout history?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For most of history, success meant control of scarce resources. One achieved that by fighting, whether literally in the case of pastoral nomads driving hunter-gatherers into marginal lands, or metaphorically in the case of Gilded Age financiers contending with one another to assemble railroad monopolies. For most of history, success meant success at zero-sum games. In most of them, meanness was not a handicap but probably an advantage."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of innovation in today's competitive landscape compared to traditional zero-sum games?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That is changing. Increasingly, the games that matter are not zero-sum. You win not by fighting to get control of a scarce resource, but by having new ideas and building new things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What conditions are necessary for new ideas to flourish and be valued in society?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There have long been games where you won by having new ideas. In the third century BC, Archimedes won by doing that, at least until an invading Roman army killed him. This illustrates why this change is happening: for new ideas to matter, you need a certain degree of civil order. And not just the absence of war; you also need to prevent the sort of economic violence that nineteenth-century magnates practiced against one another and that communist countries practiced against their citizens. People need to feel that what they create can't be stolen."}]}

That has always been the case for thinkers, which is why this trend began with them. When you think of successful people from history who weren't ruthless, you get mathematicians, writers, and artists. The exciting thing is that their modus operandi seems to be spreading. The games played by intellectuals are leaking into the real world, and this is reversing the historical polarity of the relationship between meanness and success."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What lesson did the author learn about the impact of meanness on success while raising their children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Iâm really glad I stopped to think about this. Jessica and I have always worked hard to teach our kids not to be mean. We tolerate noise, mess, and junk food, but not meanness. And now I have both an additional reason to crack down on it and an additional argument to use when I do: that being mean makes you fail."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates founders to believe in the impact of their startups, despite the likelihood that not all improve the world?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's unlikely that every successful startup improves the world.

The reason was that we discovered we were using an nÂ² algorithm, and we needed to buy time to fix it. Fortunately, we've come up with several techniques for sharding YC, and the problem now seems to be fixed. With a new, more scalable model and only 53 companies, the current batch feels like a walk in the park. I'd guess we can grow another 2 or 3x before hitting the next bottleneck."}]}

Now there's a third: start your own company. That's a big change. In principle, it was possible to start your own company in 1986 too, but it didn't seem like a real possibility. It seemed possible to start a consulting company or a niche product company, but it didn't seem possible to start a company that would become big."}]}

I think we're still at the beginning of this one. It's hard to predict how big a deal it will be. As big a deal as the Industrial Revolution? Maybe. Probably not.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the increasing prevalence of startups in today's economy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other big driver of change is that startups are becoming cheaper to start. In fact, the decreasing cost of starting a startup is one of the reasons startups are becoming a more normal thing to do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the reduced financial requirement for startups affect the power dynamics between founders and investors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fact that startups need less money means founders will increasingly have the upper hand over investors. You still need just as much of their energy and imagination, but they don't need as much of your money. Because founders have the upper hand, they'll retain an increasingly large share of the stock in their companies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Will the potential decrease in startup ownership percentages for investors lead to lower overall profits?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Does that mean investors will make less money? Not necessarily, because there will be more good startups.

Are we heading for a world in which returns will be pinched by increasingly high valuations? I think the top firms will actually make more money than they have in the past. High returns don't come from investing at low valuations; they come from investing in the companies that do really well.

It used to be challenging to be an angel investor; you couldn't access the best deals unless you got lucky, like Andy Bechtolsheim. When you did invest in a startup, VCs might try to strip you of your stock when they arrived later. Now, an angel can go to something like Demo Day or AngelList and have access to the same deals VCs do. The days when VCs could wash angels out of the cap table are long gone."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the decreasing cost of failure influence the number of startups and their success rates?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The number of big hits will probably not grow linearly with the total number of new startups for two reasons. One is that the scariness of starting a startup in the old days was a pretty effective filter. Now that the cost of failing is becoming lower, we should expect founders to pursue it more. That's not a bad thing. It's common in technology for an innovation that decreases the cost of failure to increase the number of failures and yet leave you net ahead."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might the growth in the number of startups not lead to a proportional increase in successful big hits?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other reason the number of big hits won't grow proportionately to the number of startups is that there will start to be an increasing number of idea clashes. Although the finiteness of the number of good ideas is not the reason there are only 15 big hits a year, the number has to be finite. The more startups there are, the more we'll see multiple companies doing the same thing at the same time. It will be interesting, in a bad way, if idea clashes become a lot more common."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How will the structure of successful startups evolve in response to early failures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mostly because of the increasing number of early failures, the startup business of the future won't simply be the same shape, scaled up. What used to be an obelisk will become a pyramid. It will be a little wider at the top, but a lot wider at the bottom."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists tend to invest excessively at the series A stage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right now, VCs often knowingly invest too much money at the series A stage. They do it because they feel they need to get a big chunk of each series A company to compensate for the opportunity cost of the board seat it consumes. This means that when there is a lot of competition for a deal, the number that moves is the valuation (and thus the amount invested) rather than the percentage of the company being sold. Consequently, especially in the case of more promising startups, series A investors often make companies take more money than they want."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors have contributed to the changing dynamics between venture capitalists and founders in funding rounds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The dynamics between venture capitalists and founders have changed due to several factors. Like a lot of bad things, this didn't happen intentionally. The VC business backed into it as their initial assumptions gradually became obsolete. The traditions and financial models of the VC business were established when founders needed investors more. In those days, it was natural for founders to sell VCs a big chunk of their company in the Series A round. Now, founders would prefer to sell less, and VCs are digging in their heels because they're not sure if they can make money buying less than 20% of each Series A company."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What potential shift in Series A investment strategies could benefit early-stage venture capitalists?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason I describe this as a danger is that Series A investors are increasingly at odds with the startups they supposedly serve, and that tends to come back to bite you eventually. The reason I describe it as an opportunity is that there is now a lot of potential energy built up, as the market has moved away from VCs' traditional business model. This means the first VC to break ranks and start to do Series A rounds for as much equity as founders want to sell (and with no \"option pool\" that comes only from the founders' shares) stands to reap huge benefits."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How could a top-tier VC firm alter its investment strategy to gain a competitive advantage in attracting the best startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If one top-tier VC firm started to do Series A rounds that began from the amount the company needed to raise and let the percentage acquired vary with the market, instead of the other way around, they'd instantly get almost all the best startups. And that's where the money is."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should investors focus on to identify new investment opportunities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you want to find new opportunities for investing, look for things founders complain about. Founders are your customers, and the things they complain about are unsatisfied demand. I've given two examples of things founders complain about mostâinvestors who take too long to make up their minds and excessive dilution in Series A roundsâso those are good places to look now. But the more general recipe is: do something founders want."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary indicator of success for a startup, according to the author?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I realize that revenue, and not fundraising, is the proper test of success for a startup. The reason we quote statistics about fundraising is that those are the numbers we have. We couldn't talk meaningfully about revenues without including the numbers from the most successful startups, and we don't have those. We often discuss revenue growth with earlier-stage startups because that's how we gauge their progress, but when companies reach a certain size, it gets presumptuous for a seed investor to do that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do market capitalizations relate to company revenues and funding round valuations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In any case, companies' market caps do eventually become a function of revenues, and post-money valuations of funding rounds are at least guesses by professionals about where those market caps will end up."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do only 287 companies have established valuations despite many having raised funds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason only 287 companies have valuations is that the rest have mostly raised money on convertible notes. Although convertible notes often have valuation caps, a valuation cap is merely an upper bound on a valuation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role has the shift from corporate employment to entrepreneurship played in the rising economic inequality in the US since the mid-twentieth century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This trend is one of the main causes of the increase in economic inequality in the US since the mid-twentieth century. The person who would have been the general manager of the X division of Megacorp in 1950 is now the founder of the X company and owns significant equity in it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might increasing idea clashes among startups redefine the competitive landscape for them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If idea clashes got bad enough, it could change what it means to be a startup. We currently advise startups mostly to ignore competitors. We tell them startups are competitive like running, not like soccer; you don't have to go and steal the ball away from the other team. But if idea clashes became common enough, maybe you'd start to have to. That would be unfortunate."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the core advice derived from the common regrets of individuals reflecting on their lives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you had to compress them into a single piece of advice, it might be: don't be a cog. The five regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial man, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances, then turns dutifully until he stops."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What types of mistakes often lead to feelings of regret in life?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The alarming thing is that the mistakes that produce these regrets are all errors of omission. You forget your dreams, ignore your family, suppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be happy. Errors of omission are a particularly dangerous type of mistake because you make them by default."}]}

I say \"um\" a lot. Sometimes I have to pause when I lose my train of thought. I wish I were a better speaker. But I don't wish I were a better speaker like I wish I were a better writer.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the speaker have after comparing their presentation to another speaker's performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I first noticed this at a conference several years ago. There was another speaker who was much better than me. He had all of us roaring with laughter. I seemed awkward and halting by comparison. Afterward, I put my talk online like I usually do. As I was doing it, I tried to imagine what a transcript of the other guy's talk would be like, and it was only then I realized he hadn't said very much."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the speaker have about the importance of ideas in speaking compared to writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more about speaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas mattered in speaking than in writing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the speaker have after listening to a famous speaker?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A few years later, I heard a talk by someone who was not merely a better speaker than me, but a famous speaker. Boy, was he good. So I decided I'd pay close attention to what he said to learn how he did it. After about ten sentences, I found myself thinking, \"I don't want to be a good speaker.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the process of writing compare to speaking in front of a live audience in terms of idea generation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Occasionally, the stimulation of talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, but in general, this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing does, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unique value do talks provide compared to written sources?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So are talks useless? They're certainly inferior to the written word as a source of ideas. But that's not all talks are good for. When I go to a talk, it's usually because I'm interested in the speaker. Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get to having a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn't have time to meet individually with all the people who want to meet him."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does public speaking play in motivation and emotional influence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Talks are also good at motivating me to do things. It's probably no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as motivational speakers. That may be what public speaking is really for; it's probably what it was originally for. The emotional reactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force. I wish I could say that this force was more often used for good than ill, but I'm not sure."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes the audience's expectations at academic talks from those at other types of presentations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While the audience at an academic talk might appreciate a joke, they will (or at least should) make a conscious effort to see what new ideas you're presenting. This distinguishes their expectations from those at other types of presentations, where entertainment or engagement might take precedence over the introduction of new concepts."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can reading a talk out loud improve its quality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Robert Morris points out that there is a way in which practicing talks makes them better: reading a talk out loud can expose awkward parts. I agree, and in fact, I read most things I write out loud at least once for that reason."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "At what audience size does participation begin to negatively impact individual intelligence during discussions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For sufficiently small audiences, it may not be true that being part of an audience makes people dumber.

That was our favorite part of the Bay Area. But we didn't have time to get a building in Berkeley. We didn't have time to get our own building anywhere. The only way to get enough space in time was to convince Trevor to let us take over part of his (as it then seemed) giant building in Mountain View. Yet again we lucked out because Mountain View turned out to be the ideal place to put something like YC. But even then we barely made it. The first dinner in California, we had to warn all the founders not to touch the walls because the paint was still wet."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the unique legal case involving a food shop owner and a student in Ooka Tadasuke's court?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As a child, I read a book of stories about a famous judge in eighteenth-century Japan called Ooka Tadasuke. One of the cases he decided was brought by the owner of a food shop. A poor student, who could afford only rice, was eating his rice while enjoying the delicious cooking smells coming from the food shop. The owner wanted the student to pay for the smells he was enjoying."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How could the commercialization of smells be applied in a future scenario, such as living on a moon base?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It sounds ridiculous to us to treat smells as property.

I could envision air suppliers adding scents at an extra charge."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the concept of property evolved over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The concept of property depends on what society treats as property. This can change over time, and it has changed significantly. Humans may have always treated small items carried on one's person as property. However, hunter-gatherers did not treat land, for example, as property in the same way we do today."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates the decision-making of executives in labels and studios, and how does it impact their response to technological change?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason I say short-term greed is that the underlying problem with the labels and studios is that the people who run them are driven by bonuses rather than equity. If they were driven by equity, they'd be looking for ways to take advantage of technological change instead of fighting it. But building new things takes too long. Their bonuses depend on this year's revenues, and the best way to increase those is to extract more money from stuff they do already."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it indicate about someone's definition of property when they engage in mass lawsuits and advocate for laws that could disrupt the Internet?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ultimately, it comes down to common sense. When you're abusing the legal system by trying to use mass lawsuits against randomly chosen people as a form of exemplary punishment, or lobbying for laws that would break the Internet if they passed, that's ipso facto evidence you're using a definition of property that doesn't work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does technological progress influence the definition of property and society's ability to adapt to these changes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The change in the definition of property is driven mostly by technological progress. Since technological progress is accelerating, the rate of change in the definition of property will presumably increase as well. This makes it all the more important for societies to respond gracefully to such changes, as they will come at an ever-increasing rate."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the definition of property impact technological development, according to historical examples?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The state of technology isn't simply a function of the definition of property; they each constrain the other. However, you can't mess with the definition of property without affecting (and probably harming) the state of technology. The history of the USSR offers a vivid illustration of that."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did web designers face in terms of typography before the introduction of antialiased fonts in browsers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Browsers at the time (with IE 6 still three years in the future) had few fonts, and they weren't antialiased. If you wanted to make pages that looked good, you had to render display text as images."}]}

We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores, so it was a little alarming to have users who generated lots of traffic. I once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth, and it was about $300/month."}]}

We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec) coming into our offices. In those days, there was no AWS. Even colocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things went wrong with them. So we had our servers in our offices. Or more precisely, in Trevor's office. In return for the unique privilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to share it with 6 shrieking tower servers.

When I was a kid, I thought they helped. I believed they protected inventors from having their ideas stolen by big companies. Maybe that was truer in the past, when more things were physical. But regardless of whether patents are, in general, a good thing, there do seem to be bad ways of using them. Since bad uses of patents seem to be increasing, there is an increasing call for patent reform."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What alternative approach can be taken to address issues related to patent reform?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The problem with patent reform is that it has to go through the government. That tends to be slow. But recently, I realized we can also attack the problem downstream. As well as pinching off the stream of patents at the point where they're issued, we may, in some cases, be able to pinch it off at the point where they're used."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can companies be encouraged to avoid unethical competitive practices?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The way to do it is to get the companies that are above pulling this sort of trick to pledge publicly not to. Then the ones that won't make such a pledge will be very conspicuous. Potential employees won't want to work for them. And investors, too, will be able to see that they're the sort of company that competes by litigation rather than by making good products."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of a company's public ethical standards in attracting top talent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A company's public ethical standards are significant in attracting top talent. The patent pledge is not legally binding; it's like Google's \"Don't be evil.\" They don't define what evil is, but by publicly stating that, they're indicating their willingness to be held to a standard that, say, Altria is not. Though constraining, \"Don't be evil\" has been good for Google. Technology companies win by attracting the most productive people, and the most productive individuals are drawn to employers who hold themselves to a higher standard than the law requires."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do leading technology companies like Google and Facebook refrain from suing startups for patent infringement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most technology companies wouldn't sink to using patents on startups. You don't see Google or Facebook suing startups for patent infringement. They don't need to. For the better technology companies, the patent pledge requires no change in behavior. They're just promising to do what they'd do anyway. When all the companies that won't use patents on startups have said so, the holdouts will be very conspicuous."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What issue does the patent pledge address that is considered more serious than the problem of patent trolls?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The patent pledge doesn't fix every problem with patents. It won't stop patent trolls, for example; they're already pariahs. But the problem the patent pledge does fix may be more serious than the problem of patent trolls. Patent trolls are just parasites. A clumsy parasite may occasionally kill the host, but that's not its goal. Whereas companies that sue startups for patent infringement generally do it with the explicit goal of keeping their product off the market."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can individuals take action against companies that hinder innovation through patent practices?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Companies that use patents on startups are attacking innovation at the root.

It's an interesting illustration of an element of the startup ecosystem that few, except the participants, ever see: investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio companies.

The only reason we even consider calling them \"mobile devices\" is that the iPhone preceded the iPad. If the iPad had come first, we wouldn't think of the iPhone as a phone; we'd think of it as a tablet small enough to hold up to your ear."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What innovative features of the iPad could potentially replace traditional reading glasses and bathroom scales?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fact that you can change font sizes easily means the iPad effectively replaces reading glasses.

The reason tablets are going to take over the world is not (just) that Steve Jobs and Co. are industrial design wizards, but because they have this force behind them. The iPhone and the iPad have effectively drilled a hole that will allow ephemeralization to flow into a lot of new areas.

I don't want to see another era of client monoculture like the Microsoft one in the 80s and 90s.

Developers have used the accelerometer in ways Apple could never have imagined. That's the nature of platforms. The more versatile the tool, the less you can predict how people will use it. So tablet makers should be thinking: what else can we put in there? Not merely hardware, but software too. What else can we give developers access to?

When the thing we want is something we want to want, we consider technological progress good. If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that seems strictly better.

Already, someone trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of the US. That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced. You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if people don't think you're weird, you're living badly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of smoking evolved over the past two decades?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As knowledge spread about the dangers of smoking, customs changed. In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from something that seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit: from something movie stars did in publicity shots to something small huddles of addicts do outside the doors of office buildings. A lot of the change was due to legislation, of course, but the legislation couldn't have happened if customs hadn't already changed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between the evolution of social antibodies and the pace of technological progress?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It took a while, thoughâon the order of 100 years. Unless the rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new addictions, we'll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to protect us."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why has the author shifted from running to hiking as their preferred form of exercise?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My latest trick is taking long hikes. I used to think running was a better form of exercise than hiking because it took less time. Now, the slowness of hiking seems an advantage because the longer I spend on the trail, the longer I have to think without interruption."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the author view the relationship between addiction and productivity in a rapidly changing world?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sounds pretty eccentric, doesn't it? It always will when you're trying to solve problems where there are no customs yet to guide you. Maybe I can't plead Occam's razor; maybe I'm simply eccentric. But if I'm right about the acceleration of addictiveness, then this kind of lonely squirming to avoid it will increasingly be the fate of anyone who wants to get things done. We'll increasingly be defined by what we say no to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the challenges of imposing restrictions on technological progress?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Could you restrict technological progress to areas where you wanted it? Only in a limited way, without becoming a police state. And even then, your restrictions would have undesirable side effects. \"Good\" and \"bad\" technological progress aren't sharply differentiated, so you'd find you couldn't slow the latter without also slowing the former. And in any case, as Prohibition and the \"war on drugs\" show, bans often do more harm than good."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What concerns are raised about individual freedom and choice in the future of travel?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I worry we may be heading for a future in which only a few people plot their own itinerary through no-land, while everyone else books a package tour. Or, worse still, has one booked for them by the government."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What term might better describe excessive Internet use that distracts from work compared to procrastination?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People commonly use the word \"procrastination\" to describe what they do on the Internet. It seems to me too mild to describe what's happening as merely not doing work. We don't call it procrastination when someone gets drunk instead of working."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantages do users find in using an iPad over a laptop in social situations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Several people have told me they like the iPad because it lets them bring the Internet into situations where a laptop would be too conspicuous. In other words, it's a hip flask. (This is true of the iPhone too, of course, but this advantage isn't as obvious because it reads as a phone, and everyone's used to those.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary reason that people lose their wealth, according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost. If you'd asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by spending all their money. That's how it happens in books and movies, because that's the colorful way to do it. But in fact, the way most fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through bad investments."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What financial activities can lead to significant losses without immediate awareness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's hard to spend a fortune without noticing. Someone with ordinary tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of thousands of dollars without thinking, \"Wow, I'm spending a lot of money.\" Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an eye."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often perceive spending on luxuries differently than making investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments doesn't. Luxuries seem self-indulgent, and unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery, you've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms. You're not spending the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another, which is why people trying to sell you expensive things say, \"it's an investment.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges are associated with creating effective alarms for preventing bad investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The solution is to develop new alarms. This can be a tricky business because, while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you from making bad investments have to be learned and are sometimes fairly counterintuitive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the most dangerous way to lose time, according to the author's realization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A few days ago, I realized something surprising: the situation with time is much the same as with money. The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work. When you spend time having fun, you know you're being self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly. If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking about it makes me wince. I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on a sofa watching TV for two hours, let alone a whole day."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the psychological differences between spending a day doing unproductive tasks versus watching TV?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have definitely had days when I might as well have sat in front of a TV all day â days at the end of which, if I asked myself what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically, nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV. If I spent a whole day watching TV, I'd feel like I was descending into perdition. But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work. Dealing with email, for example. You do it sitting at a desk. It's not fun. So it must be work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do modern individuals face regarding self-indulgence compared to pre-industrial societies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to protect you. It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers and perhaps all pre-industrial societies. So, nature and nurture combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more virtuous types. And the worst thing is, they're not even fun."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often act extra friendly when meeting someone new?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When meeting people you don't know very well, the convention is to seem extra friendly. You smile and say \"pleased to meet you,\" whether you are or not. There's nothing dishonest about this. Everyone knows that these little social lies aren't meant to be taken literally, just as everyone knows that \"Can you pass the salt?\" is only grammatically a question."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for writers to adopt an ingratiating tone in persuasive essays?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason there's a convention of being ingratiating in print is that most essays are written to persuade. As any politician could tell you, the way to persuade people is not just to baldly state the facts; you have to add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors are contributing to the decline of labor unions if not the qualities of current union leaders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Early union organizers made heroic sacrifices to improve conditions for workers. But though labor unions are shrinking now, it's not because present union leaders are any less courageous. An employer couldn't get away with hiring thugs to beat up union leaders today, but if they did, I see no reason to believe today's union leaders would shrink from the challenge. So I think it would be a mistake to attribute the decline of unions to some kind of decline in the people who run them. Early union leaders were heroic, certainly, but we should not suppose that if unions have declined, it's because present union leaders are somehow inferior. The cause must be external."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What argument does the paragraph make about the factors contributing to the success of early union organizers compared to present-day leaders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It makes the same point: that it can't have been the personal qualities of early union organizers that made unions successful, but must have been some external factor; otherwise, present-day union leaders would have to be inferior people. However, written this way, it seems like a defense of present-day union organizers rather than an attack on early ones. That makes it more persuasive to people who like unions because it seems sympathetic to their cause."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the sacrifices made by union leaders and the notion of generational greatness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I believe everything I wrote in the second version. Early union leaders did make heroic sacrifices, and present union leaders probably would rise to the occasion if necessary. People tend to; however, I'm skeptical about the idea of \"the greatest generation.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates the author's writing approach, as opposed to the typical goal of persuasion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most writers do. Most writers write to persuade, if only out of habit or politeness. But I don't write to persuade; I write to figure out. I write to persuade a hypothetical perfectly unbiased reader."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the perception of an essay's intent differ between readers with opposing viewpoints?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since the custom is to write to persuade the actual reader, someone who doesn't will seem arrogant. In fact, worse than arrogant: since readers are used to essays that try to please someone, an essay that displeases one side in a dispute reads as an attempt to pander to the other. To a lot of pro-union readers, the first paragraph sounds like the sort of thing a right-wing radio talk show host would say to stir up his followers. But it's not. Something that curtly contradicts one's beliefs can be hard to distinguish from a partisan attack on them, but though they can end up in the same place, they come from different sources."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the risks of elaborating too much in writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The danger of elaborating too much in writing is not merely that it results in longer paragraphs. It's that you start to lie to yourself. The ideas begin to get mixed together with the spin you've added to get them past the readers' misconceptions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do writers face when attempting to persuade readers whose beliefs differ significantly from their conclusions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Writers face significant challenges when attempting to persuade readers whose beliefs differ greatly from their conclusions. The more your conclusions disagree with readers' present beliefs, the more effort you'll have to expend on selling your ideas rather than having them accept your perspective. Writing to persuade and writing to discover are diametrically opposed. As you accelerate in your arguments, the resistance you encounter increases, until eventually, you reach a point where 100% of your energy is devoted to overcoming this resistance, and you can't go any faster."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges does the author face when trying to express new ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's hard enough to overcome one's own misconceptions without having to think about how to get the resulting ideas past other people's. I worry that if I wrote to persuade, I'd start to shy away unconsciously from ideas I knew would be hard to sell. When I notice something surprising, it's usually very faint at first. There's nothing more than a slight stirring of discomfort. I don't want anything to get in the way of noticing it consciously."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What emotions and memories did the author experience while writing in a familiar academic style?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I had a strange feeling of being back in high school while writing this. To get a good grade, you had to both write the sort of pious crap you were expected to and also seem to be writing with conviction. The solution was a kind of method acting. It was revoltingly familiar to slip back into it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What writing technique does the author use to engage readers without increasing word count?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Come to think of it, there is one way in which I deliberately pander to readers, because it doesn't change the number of words: I switch person. This flattering distinction seems so natural to the average reader that they probably don't notice even when I switch in mid-sentence, though you tend to notice when it's done as conspicuously as this.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do the prices of books, music, and movies vary based on format rather than content quality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, consumers never really were paying for content, and publishers weren't really selling it either. If the content was what they were selling, why has the price of books, music, or movies always depended mostly on the format? Why didn't better content cost more?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do traditional publishing practices prioritize medium over content in pricing and value?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Almost every form of publishing has been organized as if the medium was what they were selling and the content was irrelevant. Book publishers, for example, set prices based on the cost of producing and distributing books. They treat the words printed in the book the same way a textile manufacturer treats the patterns printed on its fabrics."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What emotions can arise when offering someone something that may seem insignificant?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As I was leaving, I offered it to him, as I've done countless times before in the same situation. But this time something new happened. I felt that sheepish feeling you get when you offer someone something worthless. \"Do you, er, want a printout of yesterday's news?\" I asked. (He didn't.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does iTunes operate as a business model compared to traditional content stores?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What about iTunes? Doesn't that show people will pay for content? Well, not really. iTunes is more of a tollbooth than a store. Apple controls the default path onto the iPod. They offer a convenient list of songs, and whenever you choose one, they ding your credit card for a small amount, just below the threshold of attention. Basically, iTunes makes money by taxing people, not selling them stuff. You can only do that if you own the channel, and even then you don't make much from it because a toll has to be ignorable to work. Once a toll becomes painful, people start to find ways around it, and that's pretty easy with digital content."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why can software companies charge high prices for their products?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Software companies can charge high prices for their products because many of their customers are businesses, who are willing to pay more for the value that software provides. While some may argue that software is just information, the demand from businesses and the unique features of software products justify the higher prices."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the necessity of software like Photoshop differ from the necessity of songs or articles for users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If they use pirated versions, and though in form merely information, software is treated by both maker and purchaser as a different type of thing from a song or an article. A Photoshop user needs Photoshop in a way that no one needs a particular song or article."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes the revenue stability of the movie business from that of the news and music industries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most promising countertrend is the premium cable channel; people still pay for those. However, broadcasting isn't publishing: you're not selling a copy of something. That's one reason the movie business hasn't seen its revenues decline the way the news and music businesses haveâthey only have one foot in publishing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential strategies for monetizing content in publishing when direct sales are not possible?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What happens to publishing if you can't sell content? You have two choices: give it away and make money from it indirectly, or find ways to embody it in things people will pay for."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What potential changes could the movie industry undergo to attract audiences back to theaters?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's harder to say what will happen to movies. They could evolve into ads, or they could return to their roots and make going to the theater a treat. If they made the experience good enough, audiences might start to prefer it to watching pirated movies at home."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might the shift to digital reading options impact the market for printed books?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shift to digital reading options may impact the market for printed books significantly. As long as buying printed books was the only way to read them, they maintained a strong market presence. However, if printed books become optional, publishers will have to work harder to entice people to buy them. There should be some market for printed books, but it's hard to foresee how big it will be, as its size will depend not on macro trends like the amount people read, but on the ingenuity of individual publishers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the impact of change on the future?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't know exactly what the future will look like, but I'm not too worried about it. This sort of change tends to create as many good things as it kills. Indeed, the really interesting question is not what will happen to existing forms, but what new forms will appear."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria can be used to identify potential winners and losers in emerging technologies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What new forms will appear? But though I can't predict specific winners, I can offer a recipe for recognizing them. When you see something that's taking advantage of new technology to give people something they want that they couldn't have before, you're probably looking at a winner. And when you see something that's merely reacting to new technology in an attempt to preserve some existing source of revenue, you're probably looking at a loser."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why does the author prefer to avoid the word \"content\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't like the word \"content\" and have tried for a while to avoid using it, but I have to admit there's no other word that means the right thing. \"Information\" is too general."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the value of \"content\" in relation to its treatment by publishers and audiences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ironically, the main reason I don't like \"content\" is the thesis of this essay. The word suggests an undifferentiated slurry, but economically, that's how both publishers and audiences treat it. Content is information you don't need."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some magazines feature articles with titles that begin with numbers on their covers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some magazines feature articles with titles that begin with numbers on their covers, such as \"7 Things He Won't Tell You about Sex.\" Popular magazines often include articles of this type on the cover of every issue. That can't be happening by accident; editors must know that these titles attract readers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes a list of items from a traditional essay in terms of structure and content?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Structurally, the list of n things is a degenerate case of an essay. An essay can go anywhere the writer wants. In a list of n things, the writer agrees to constrain himself to a collection of points of roughly equal importance, and he tells the reader explicitly what they are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the characteristics of the structure described in the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The structure is characterized by being explicit and guaranteed to be of the simplest possible type: a few main points with few to no subordinate ones, and no particular connection between them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of presenting information in a list format?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because the main points are unconnected, the list of n things is random access. There's no thread of reasoning you have to follow. You could read the list in any order. And because the points are independent of one another, they work like watertight compartments in an unsinkable ship. If you get bored with, or can't understand, or don't agree with one point, you don't have to give up on the article. You can just abandon that one and skip to the next. A list of n things is parallel and therefore fault tolerant."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated the author to create a catalog with a numbered title despite receiving criticism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A few people made fun of me for writing something whose title began with a number. But in that case, I really was trying to make a complete catalog of a number of independent things. In fact, one of the questions I was trying to answer was how many there were."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of using a list format in writing essays?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The list of advantages is easier for writers as well as readers. When you're writing a real essay, there's always a chance you'll hit a dead end. A real essay is a train of thought, and some trains of thought just peter out. That's an alarming possibility when you have to give a talk in a few days. What if you run out of ideas? The compartmentalized structure of a list protects the writer from his own stupidity in much the same way it protects the reader. If you run out of ideas on one point, no problem: it won't kill the essay. You can take out the whole point if you need to, and the essay will still survive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of creating a list as a method for organizing thoughts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Writing a list of n things is so relaxing. You think of n/2 of them in the first 5 minutes. So bang, there's the structure, and you just have to fill it in. As you think of more points, you just add them to the end. Maybe you take out or rearrange or combine a few, but at every stage, you have a valid (though initially low-res) list of n things. It's like the sort of programming where you write a version 1 very quickly and then gradually modify it, but at every point have working codeâor the style of painting where you begin with a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour, then spend a week cranking up the resolution."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are list essays considered a suitable format for beginning writers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because the list of n things is the easiest essay form, it should be a good one for beginning writers. In fact, it is what most beginning writers are taught. The classic five-paragraph essay is really a list of n things for n = 3. However, the students writing them don't realize they're using the same structure as the articles they read."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why should students be encouraged to create open lists of n things without transitions or conclusions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems a fine plan to start students off with a list of n things. It's the easiest form. But if we're going to do that, why not do it openly? Let them write lists of n things like the pros, with numbers and no transitions or conclusions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you consider when using \"The\" in the title of a list?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's fine to put \"The\" before the number if you really believe you've made an exhaustive list. However, evidence suggests that most things with titles like this are linkbait."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of the 5 paragraph essay format for beginner writers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another advantage of admitting to beginning writers that the 5 paragraph essay is really a list of n things is that we can warn them about this. It only lets you experience the defining characteristic of essay writing on a small scale: in thoughts of a sentence or two. And it's particularly dangerous that the 5 paragraph essay buries the list of n things within something that looks like a more sophisticated type of essay. If you don't know you're using this form, you don't know you need to escape it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates users to utilize Delicious for bookmarking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Delicious users are motivated by their desire to bookmark and collect information.

Though she'd heard a lot about YC since the beginning, the last nine months have been a total immersion."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did Kate have about the risk of failure in startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Kate knew in principle that startups were very risky, but she was surprised to see how constant the threat of failure wasânot just for the minnows, but even for the famous startups whose founders came to speak at YC dinners."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it common for startups to pivot significantly by Demo Day?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By Demo Day, about half the startups were doing something significantly different than they started with. We encourage that. Starting a startup is like science in that you have to follow the truth wherever it leads. In the rest of the world, people don't start things until they're sure what they want to do, and once started, they tend to continue on their initial path even if it's mistaken."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do you feel about the consistency between speakers and the guidance provided to startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Actually, I've noticed this too. I always worry that the speakers will put us in an embarrassing position by contradicting what we tell the startups, but it happens surprisingly rarely."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What key lessons about startup success did she highlight from her experience with speakers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I asked her what specific things she remembered speakers always saying, she mentioned that the way to succeed was to launch something fast, listen to users, and then iterate; that startups required resilience because they were always an emotional rollercoaster; and that most VCs were sheep."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the approach to launching and iterating business ideas changed over the past decade?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have been impressed by how consistently the speakers advocate launching fast and iterating.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Segway's initial success and lack of real-world feedback contribute to their eventual challenges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Curiously enough, what got Segway into this problem was that the company was itself a kind of Segway. It was too easy for them; they were too successful raising money. If they'd had to grow the company gradually, by iterating through several versions they sold to real users, they'd have learned pretty quickly that people looked stupid riding them. Instead, they had enough to work in secret. They had focus groups aplenty, I'm sure, but they didn't have the people yelling insults out of cars. So, they never realized they were zooming confidently down a blind alley."}]}

If startups end up being like the movie business, with just a handful of centers and one dominant one, that is going to have novel consequences."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do startups struggle to replicate their success in different locations compared to traditional industries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups don't seem to spread as well, partly because they're more of a social than a technical phenomenon, and partly because they're not tied to geography. An individual European manufacturer could import industrial techniques, and they'd work fine.

Seattle owes much of its position as a tech center to the same cause: Gates and Allen wanted to move home. Otherwise, Albuquerque might have Seattle's place in the rankings. Boston is a tech center because it's the intellectual capital of the U.S. and probably the world. And if Battery Ventures hadn't turned down Facebook, Boston would be significantly bigger now on the startup radar screen."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did Facebook receive funding in Silicon Valley rather than Boston?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is not a coincidence that Facebook received funding in Silicon Valley rather than Boston.

Then the town would be hospitable to both groups you need: both founders and investors. That's the combination that yielded Silicon Valley. However, Silicon Valley didn't have Silicon Valley to compete with. If you tried now to create a startup hub by planting a great university in a nice place, it would have a harder time getting started because many of the best startups it produced would be sucked away to existing startup hubs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the impact of clustering successful startups in a specific location?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Once you have enough good startups in one place, it creates a self-sustaining chain reaction.

Most computer/software startups are now the first type, and most pharmaceutical startups are the second. When I talk about startups in this essay, I mean type I startups. There is no difficulty in making type II startups spread; all you have to do is fund medical research labs. Commercializing whatever new discoveries the boffins throw off is as straightforward as building a new airport. Type II startups neither require nor produce startup culture. But that means having type II startups won't get you type I startups. Philadelphia is a case in point: lots of type II startups, but hardly any type I."}]}

His critical invention was a refinement that made steam engines dramatically more efficient: the separate condenser. But that oversimplifies his role. He had such a different attitude toward the problem and approached it with such energy that he transformed the field. Perhaps the most accurate way to put it would be to say that Watt reinvented the steam engine."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role did geographical location play in the success of companies like Kazaa and Skype?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Geographical location played a significant role in the success of companies like Kazaa and Skype. If you're doing something that would get shut down in the US, it becomes an advantage to be located elsewhere. That's why Kazaa took the place of Napster. Additionally, the expertise and connections the founders gained from running Kazaa helped ensure the success of Skype."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What makes the new messaging protocol mentioned in the paragraph significant in the context of existing communication protocols?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The significance of the new messaging protocol lies in the fact that it does not require specifying recipients. New protocols are rare, and more precisely, those that gain widespread adoption are even rarer. There are only a handful of commonly used ones: TCP/IP (the Internet), SMTP (email), HTTP (the web), and so on. Therefore, any new protocol is a big deal. Additionally, Twitter is a protocol owned by a private company, which makes it even rarer."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might Twitter's slow approach to monetization contribute to its widespread adoption?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Curiously, the fact that the founders of Twitter have been slow to monetize it may, in the long run, prove to be an advantage. Because they haven't tried to control it too much, Twitter feels to everyone like previous protocols. One forgets it's owned by a private company. That must have made it easier for Twitter to spread."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary obstacle to the creation of new startups in the US?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy, employment law, or even Sarbanes-Oxley.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the definition of a startup be effectively determined?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The tricky part might seem to be how one defines a startup.

While 10,000 people may seem like a small number in terms of immigration, it would represent a substantial increase in the pool of startup founders. I believe this would have such a visible effect on the economy that it could make the legislator who introduced the bill famous. The only way to know for sure would be to try it, and that would cost practically nothing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who is considered the most influential founder in startup culture and why?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would guess Steve Jobs is the most influential founder, not just for me but for most people you could ask.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the doctrine of the elect relate to startup investing, according to the author's experience with Sama?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What I learned from meeting Sama is that the doctrine of the elect applies to startups. It applies way less than most people think: startup investing does not consist of trying to pick winners the way you might in a horse race. But there are a few people with such force of will that they're going to get whatever they want."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the basic mechanics of investing in a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, really isn't. You give a startup money, and they give you stock. You'll probably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra rights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertible debt, which means (on paper) you're lending the company money, and the debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big funding round."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should novice angel investors focus on instead of the specifics of deal terms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't spend much time worrying about the details of deal terms, especially when you first start angel investing.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key factor for success in startup investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The key factor for success in startup investments is investing in the right startups.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the typical structure of a syndicate formed by angel investors when investing in a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Angel investors often syndicate deals, which means they join together to invest on the same terms. In a syndicate, there is usually a \"lead\" investor who negotiates the terms with the startup. However, this is not always the case; sometimes the startup cobbles together a syndicate of investors who approach them independently, and the startup's lawyer supplies the paperwork."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a simple way for beginners to start angel investing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The easiest way to get started in angel investing is to find a friend who already does it and try to get included in his syndicates.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors should you consider when negotiating investment terms with a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you negotiate terms with a startup, there are two numbers you care about: how much money you're putting in and the valuation of the company. The valuation determines how much stock you get. If you put $50,000 into a company at a pre-money valuation of $1 million, then the post-money valuation is $1.05 million, and you get 0.05/1.05, or 4.76% of the company's stock."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does raising additional funds affect the ownership percentage of existing shareholders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If the company raises more money later, the new investor will take a chunk of the company away from all the existing shareholders, just as you did. If, in the next round, they sell 10% of the company to a new investor, your 4.76% will be reduced to 4.28%."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can multiple rounds of investment increase the value of a startup while reducing an investor's ownership percentage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In theory, each further round of investment leaves you with a smaller share of an even more valuable company. After several more rounds, you might end up with 0.5% of the company at the point where it IPOs, and you are very happy because your $50,000 has become $5 million."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should be included in an investment agreement to prevent dilution of ownership percentage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The agreement by which you invest should have provisions that let you contribute to future rounds to maintain your percentage.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the typical range of investment amounts from angel investors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How much does an angel invest? That varies enormously, from $10,000 to hundreds of thousands or, in rare cases, even millions. The upper bound is obviously the total amount the founders want to raise. The lower bound is 5-10% of the total or $10,000, whichever is greater. A typical angel round these days might be $150,000 raised from 5 people."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the typical range for valuations in angel rounds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Valuations don't vary as much.

It's not as simple as picking startups that are already making something wildly popular; by then, it's too late for angels, as venture capitalists will already be onto them. As an angel, you have to pick startups before they've got a hitâeither because they've created something great that users don't realize is valuable yet, like Google early on, or because they're still an iteration or two away from the big hit, like PayPal when they were developing software for transferring money between PDAs."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can empathy contribute to identifying successful startup founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Empathy can contribute to identifying successful startup founders by allowing you to resonate with them on a deeper level.

If there were a word that meant the opposite of hapless, that would be the one. Bad founders seem hapless. They may be smart or not, but somehow events overwhelm them, and they get discouraged and give up. Good founders make things happen the way they want. Which is not to say they force things to happen in a predefined way. Good founders have a healthy respect for reality. But they are relentlessly resourceful.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can an investor effectively source high-quality startup opportunities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The problem is not finding startups, exactly, but finding a stream of reasonably high-quality ones. The traditional way to do this is through contacts. If you're friends with a lot of investors and founders, they'll send deals your way. The Valley basically runs on referrals.

No matter how smart and nice you seem, insiders will be reluctant to send you referrals until you've proven yourself by making a couple of investments. Some smart, nice guys turn out to be flaky, high-maintenance investors. However, once you prove yourself as a good investor, the deal flow, as they call it, will increase rapidly in both quality and quantity. At the extreme, for someone like Ron Conway, it is basically identical to the deal flow of the whole Valley."}]}

When we talk to founders about good and bad investors, one of the ways we describe the good ones is to say, \"he writes checks.\" That doesn't mean the investor says yes to everyone; far from it. It means he makes up his mind quickly and follows through. You may be thinking, how hard could that be? You'll see when you try it. It follows from the nature of angel investing that the decisions are hard. You have to guess early, at the stage when the most promising ideas still seem counterintuitive, because if they were obviously good, VCs would already have funded them."}]}

For every rich person (you probably shouldn't try angel investing unless you think of yourself as rich), there's some amount that would be painless, though annoying, to lose. Until you feel comfortable investing, don't invest more than that per startup."}]}

Angel investing is not a business where you make money by screwing people over. Startups create wealth, and creating wealth is not a zero-sum game. No one has to lose for you to win.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities do successful angel investors share in their approach to helping startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most successful angel investors I know are all basically good people. Once they invest in a company, all they want to do is help it. And they'll help people they haven't invested in too. When they do favors, they don't seem to keep track of them; it's too much overhead. They just try to help everyone and assume good things will flow back to them somehow. Empirically, that seems to work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of using capped versus discounted convertible debt for investors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Convertible debt can be either capped at a particular valuation or can be done at a discount to whatever the valuation turns out to be when it converts. For example, convertible debt at a discount of 30% means that when it converts, you get stock as if you'd invested at a 30% lower valuation. This can be useful in cases where you can't or don't want to figure out what the valuation should be; you leave it to the next investor. On the other hand, a lot of investors want to know exactly what they're getting, so they will only do convertible debt with a cap."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary cost associated with creating legal agreements, and how does the series AA paperwork address this issue?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The expensive part of creating an agreement from scratch is not writing the agreement, but bickering at several hundred dollars an hour over the details. That's why the series AA paperwork aims at a middle ground. You can just start from the compromise you'd have reached after lots of back and forth."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to use specialized lawyers when funding a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you fund a startup, both your lawyers should be specialists in startups. Do not use ordinary corporate lawyers for this. Their inexperience makes them overbuild; they'll create huge, overcomplicated agreements and spend hours arguing over irrelevant things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the top startup law firms in Silicon Valley and Boston?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the Valley, the top startup law firms are Wilson Sonsini, Orrick, Fenwick & West, Gunderson Dettmer, and Cooley Godward. In Boston, the best are Goodwin Procter, Wilmer Hale, and Foley Hoag."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential consequences for existing shareholders if VCs decide to recapitalize a company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason you don't want to give them up is the following scenario: the VCs recapitalize the company, meaning they give it additional funding at a pre-money valuation of zero. This wipes out the existing shareholders, including both you and the founders. They then grant the founders lots of options because they need them to stay around, but you get nothing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the ethical considerations for venture capitalists when recapitalizing a company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The ethical considerations for venture capitalists when recapitalizing a company can be complex. It is generally viewed as unethical to recapitalize a company solely to take advantage of earlier investors, such as angels, by diluting their ownership. While reputable, brand-name VCs typically would not engage in such practices, there exists a continuum of behavior among VCs. A less scrupulous, lower-tier VC might be tempted to recapitalize in a way that unjustly benefits them at the expense of earlier investors, potentially stealing a significant portion of stock."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When might it be acceptable for an investor to forgo anti-dilution protections?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not saying you should always absolutely refuse to give up your anti-dilution protections. Everything is a negotiation. If you're part of a powerful syndicate, you might be able to give up legal protections and rely on social ones. If you invest in a deal led by a big angel like Ron Conway, for example, you're pretty well protected against being mistreated because any VC would think twice before crossing him. This kind of protection is one of the reasons angels like to invest in syndicates."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential consequences of investing too much in a startup at a low valuation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't invest so much, or at such a low valuation, that you end up with an excessively large share of a startup, unless you're sure your money will be the last they ever need. Later-stage investors won't invest in a company if the founders don't have enough equity left to motivate them. I talked to a VC recently who said he'd met with a company he really liked, but he turned them down because investors already owned more than half of it. Those investors probably thought they'd been pretty clever by getting such a large chunk of this desirable company, but in fact, they were shooting themselves in the foot."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the typical financial performance of venture capital firms, and how does it relate to their existence in the market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The typical financial performance of venture capital firms is somewhat surprising, as the median VC loses money. This is one of the most surprising things I've learned about VC while working at Y Combinator. Only a fraction of VCs even have positive returns. The rest exist to satisfy demand among fund managers for venture capital as an asset class. Learning this explained a lot about some of the VCs I encountered when we were working on Viaweb."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do venture capitalists prioritize when selecting investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "VCs also generally say they prefer great markets to great people. But what they're really saying is they want both. They're so selective that they only even consider great people. So when they say they care above all about big markets, they mean that's how they choose between great people."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do founders prefer investors who are willing to lead in funding rounds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Founders rightly dislike the sort of investor who says he's interested in investing but doesn't want to lead. There are circumstances where this is an acceptable excuse, but more often than not, what it means is, \"No, but if you turn out to be a hot deal, I want to be able to claim retroactively I said yes.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the relationship between computers and television evolved over the past two decades?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "About twenty years ago, people noticed that computers and TV were on a collision course and started to speculate about what they'd produce when they converged. We now know the answer: computers. It's clear now that even by using the word \"convergence,\" we were giving TV too much credit. This won't be convergence so much as replacement. People may still watch things they call \"TV shows,\" but they'll watch them mostly on computers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantage does the Internet's open platform provide for innovation and competition?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One predictable cause of victory is that the Internet is an open platform. Anyone can build whatever they want on it, and the market picks the winners. So, innovation happens at hacker speeds instead of big company speeds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has piracy influenced the preference for watching shows on computers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The third reason computers won is piracy. Users prefer it not just because it's free, but because it's more convenient. BitTorrent and YouTube have already trained a new generation of viewers that the place to watch shows is on a computer screen."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How have innovations in communication changed the way teenagers interact with their friends compared to previous generations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The somewhat more surprising force was one specific type of innovation: social applications. The average teenage kid has a pretty much infinite capacity for talking to their friends, but they can't physically be with them all the time. When I was in high school, the solution was the telephone. Now it's social networks, multiplayer games, and various messaging applications. The way you reach them all is through a computer."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key motivations and behaviors of teenagers regarding computer and internet usage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Every teenage kid (a) wants a computer with an Internet connection, (b) has an incentive to figure out how to use it, and (c) spends countless hours in front of it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the main motivation that drove widespread interest in computers among various groups of people?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main motivation that drove widespread interest in computers among various groups of people was the desire to connect with others. This was the most powerful force of all. Nerds got computers because they liked them, gamers got them to play games, but it was the ability to connect to other people that attracted everyone else: that's what made even grandmas and 14-year-old girls want computers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of audience engagement in the entertainment industry evolved over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "After decades of running an IV drip right into their audience, people in the entertainment business had understandably come to think of them as rather passive. They thought they could dictate the way shows reached audiences. However, they underestimated the force of their desire to connect with one another."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges are traditional TV networks facing in adapting to the rise of online content consumption?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The TV networks already seem, grudgingly, to see where things are going and have responded by putting their content online. However, they are still dragging their heels. They still seem to wish people would watch shows on TV instead, just as newspapers that put their stories online still seem to wish people would wait until the next morning to read them printed on paper. They should both just face the fact that the Internet is the primary medium."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should companies do when a new, potentially disruptive medium emerges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When a new medium arises that's powerful enough to make incumbents nervous, then it's probably powerful enough to win. The best thing companies can do is jump in immediately. They'd be in a better position if they'd done that earlier."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How is the rise of the Internet impacting traditional broadcast media, particularly local television?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whether they like it or not, big changes are coming because the Internet dissolves the two cornerstones of broadcast media: synchronicity and locality. On the Internet, you don't have to send everyone the same signal, and you don't have to send it to them from a local source. People will watch what they want when they want it and group themselves according to whatever shared interest they feel most strongly. Maybe their strongest shared interest will be their physical location, but I'm guessing not. This means local TV is probably dead. It was an artifact of limitations imposed by old technology. If someone were creating an Internet-based TV company from scratch now, they might have some plan for shows aimed at specific regions, but it wouldn't be a top priority."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are TV networks struggling to adapt to changing trends in the industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TV networks will fight these trends because they don't have sufficient flexibility to adapt to them. They're hemmed in by local affiliates in much the same way car companies are hemmed in by dealers and unions. Inevitably, the people running the networks will take the easy route and try to keep the old model running for a couple more years, just as the record labels have done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the limitation of networks in their understanding of their role in communication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The networks are prevented from seeing this whole line of reasoning because they still think of themselves as being in the broadcast businessâas sending one signal to everyone."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors indicate that now is an opportune moment for startups to compete with traditional TV networks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now would be a good time to start any company that competes with TV networks. That's what a lot of Internet startups are, though they may not have had this as an explicit goal. People only have so many leisure hours a day, and TV is premised on such long sessions (unlike Google, which prides itself on sending users on their way quickly) that anything that takes up their time is competing with it. In addition to such indirect competitors, I think TV companies will increasingly face direct ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the role of networks in show distribution evolved with the rise of self-distribution by producers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The rise of self-distribution by producers has changed the balance of power between networks and show creators. Networks used to be the gatekeepers; they distributed content and sold advertising for it. Now, producers can distribute their shows themselves. The main value that networks provide now is ad sales, which tends to position them as service providers rather than publishers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How is the future of entertainment on the Internet expected to evolve in terms of format and content?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Shows will change even more. On the Internet, there's no reason to keep their current format, or even the fact that they have a single format. Indeed, the more interesting sort of convergence that's coming is between shows and games. But on the question of what sort of entertainment gets distributed on the Internet in 20 years, I wouldn't dare to make any predictions, except that things will change a lot. We'll get whatever the most imaginative people can cook up. That's why the Internet won."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the misconceptions of phone companies in the early 90s regarding the future of video on-demand and internet bandwidth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks to Trevor Blackwell for this point. He adds: \"I remember the eyes of phone companies gleaming in the early 90s when they talked about convergence. They thought most programming would be on demand, and they would implement it and make a lot of money. It didn't work out. They assumed that their local network infrastructure would be critical to do video on demand because you couldn't possibly stream it from a few data centers over the internet. At the time (1992), the entire cross-country Internet bandwidth wasn't enough for one video stream. But wide-area bandwidth increased more than they expected, and they were beaten by iTunes and Hulu.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to users choosing piracy over legal options like iTunes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Copyright owners tend to focus on the aspect they see of piracy, which is the lost revenue. They therefore think what drives users to do it is the desire to get something for free. However, iTunes shows that people will pay for content online if you make it easy. A significant component of piracy is simply that it offers a better user experience."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What features are expected in the future device that may replace traditional televisions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A device that may replace traditional televisions is likely to have features such as a browser and the ability to access data via the Internet. I'm not making any predictions about the size of the device, but these functionalities will be essential."}]}

Anyone can broadcast a high school football game that will be interesting to 10,000 people or so, even if the quality of production is not so good.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies can a town implement to retain its startups and prevent them from relocating to areas like Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To retain startups and prevent them from relocating to areas like Silicon Valley, a town must provide enough incentives that make it less appealing for startups to accept offers from Silicon Valley VCs that require them to move. A startup would be able to refuse such an offer if they had grown to the point where they were (a) rooted in your town and/or (b) so successful that VCs would fund them even if they didn't move."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it unrealistic to expect a local Silicon Valley to develop by providing startups with only $15-20k each?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems unrealistic to expect a local Silicon Valley to develop by providing startups with only $15-20k each, like Y Combinator. This is because to make them stick around, you'd have to give them at least 20 times that much."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How much investment would it take to attract a thousand startups to a town, and what position might that achieve relative to Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "However, even that is an interesting prospect. Suppose, to be on the safe side, it would cost a million dollars per startup. If you could get startups to stick to your town for a million apiece, then for a billion dollars you could bring in a thousand startups. That probably wouldn't push you past Silicon Valley itself, but it might get you second place."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can a city develop a thriving startup ecosystem within five years?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It wouldn't take very long; you could probably do it in five years during the term of one mayor. It would get easier over time because the more startups you had in town, the less it would take to get new ones to move there. By the time you had a thousand startups in town, the VCs wouldn't be trying so hard to get them to move to Silicon Valley; instead, they'd be opening local offices. Then you'd really be in good shape. You'd have started a self-sustaining chain reaction like the one that drives the Valley."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do investors face when selecting promising startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Selecting promising startups presents several challenges for investors. The process of picking startups is a rare and valuable skill, and the handful of people who possess it are not readily hireable. Additionally, this skill is so difficult to measure that if a government attempted to hire individuals with it, they would almost certainly select the wrong candidates."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key distinction between successful and unsuccessful venture capitalists?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The key distinction between successful and unsuccessful venture capitalists lies in their ability to choose and advise startups. While all VCs may appear impressive to limited partners, the difference becomes evident in their performance in these critical areas. Unsuccessful VCs may seem impressive to city officials but struggle in selecting the right startups, which is a characteristic failure mode. Ultimately, the effectiveness of a VC is revealed in their capacity to make sound investment choices and provide valuable guidance to the companies they support."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do emerging startup cities face in attracting local angel investors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What you really want is a pool of local angel investorsâpeople investing money they made from their own startups. But unfortunately, you run into a chicken-and-egg problem here. If your city isn't already a startup hub, there won't be people there who got rich from startups. And there is no way I can think of that a city could attract angels from outside. By definition, they're rich. There's no incentive that would make them move."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can a city attract startups from outside its region?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "However, a city could attract startups by piggybacking on the expertise of investors who aren't local. It would be pretty straightforward to make a list of the most eminent Silicon Valley angels and from that to generate a list of all the startups they've invested in. If a city offered these companies a million dollars each to move, a lot of the earlier stage ones would probably take it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential impacts on startups if they receive additional funding but lose their original investors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It would hurt the startups somewhat to be separated from their original investors. On the other hand, the extra million dollars would give them a lot more runway."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a proposed method to test the viability of transplanted startups in a new city?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Would the transplanted startups survive? Quite possibly. The only way to find out would be to try it. It would be a pretty cheap experiment, as civil expenditures go. Pick 30 startups that eminent angels have recently invested in, give them each a million dollars if they'll relocate to your city, and see what happens after a year. If they seem to be thriving, you can try importing startups on a larger scale."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for startups to engage with a larger group rather than conducting small-scale experiments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups should not attempt to conduct their initial experiments on a small scale by selecting only 10 participants. If they do this, they are likely to guarantee failure. It is important for startups to engage with a larger group, as being around other startups fosters a sense of community. A group of 30 would be sufficient to create that environment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do hackers typically approach agreements and challenges in their work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hackers are much more constrained by gentlemen's agreements than regulations. If they shake your hand on a promise, they'll keep it. But show them a lock, and their first thought is how to pick it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What implications would a successful 30-startup experiment have on a city?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The 30-startup experiment could be conducted by any sufficiently wealthy private citizen. If successful, it would put significant pressure on the city to adapt and respond to the innovative changes and economic growth that such an initiative could bring."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors should be considered when assessing the feasibility of starting a business similar to those in San Francisco?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It will be easier in proportion to how much your town resembles San Francisco. Do you have good weather? Do people live downtown, or have they abandoned the center for the suburbs? Would the city be described as \"hip\" and \"tolerant,\" or as reflecting \"traditional values?\" Are there good universities nearby? Are there walkable neighborhoods? Would nerds feel at home? If you answered yes to all these questions, you might be able not only to pull off this scheme but to do it for less than a million per startup."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the applicant pool for local seed firms get influenced by the geographic distribution of applicants?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What people who start these supposedly local seed firms always find is that (a) their applicants come from all over, not just the local area, and (b) the local startups also apply to the other seed firms. So what ends up happening is that the applicant pool gets partitioned by quality rather than geography."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common mistake do ineffective venture capitalists make when selecting startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Interestingly, the bad VCs fail by choosing startups run by people like themâpeople who are good presenters but have no real substance. It's a case of the fake leading the fake. And since everyone involved is so plausible, the LPs who invest in these funds have no idea what's happening until they measure their returns."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the original purpose of Hacker News when it was created?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hacker News was two years old last week. Initially, it was supposed to be a side projectâan application to sharpen Arc on and a place for current and future Y Combinator founders to exchange news. It's grown bigger and taken up more time than I expected, but I don't regret that because I've learned so much from working on it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the author's concerns regarding the growth of their website?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The growth rate is a bit higher than I'd like. I'd like the site to grow, since a site that isn't growing at least slowly is probably dead. However, I wouldn't want it to grow as large as Digg or Redditâmainly because that would dilute the character of the site, but also because I don't want to spend all my time dealing with scaling."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the evolution and potential of online discussion platforms like Hacker News?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hacker News is an experiment, and an experiment in a very young field. Sites of this type are only a few years old. Internet conversation generally is only a few decades old. So we've probably only discovered a fraction of what we eventually will."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact did a significant mistake have on the unity of the culture?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That was a mistake. Suddenly, a culture that had been more or less united was divided into haves and have-nots. I didn't realize how united the culture had been until I saw it divided. It was painful to watch."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the broken windows theory relate to the behavior of online communities, as illustrated by changes in Reddit?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's pretty clear now that the broken windows theory applies to community sites as well. The theory is that minor forms of bad behavior encourage worse ones: that a neighborhood with lots of graffiti and broken windows becomes one where robberies occur. I was living in New York when Giuliani introduced the reforms that made the broken windows theory famous, and the transformation was miraculous. I was a Reddit user when the opposite happened there, and the transformation was equally dramatic."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the key factors that contributed to Reddit's rapid growth compared to Hacker News?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not criticizing Steve and Alexis. What happened to Reddit didn't occur out of neglect. From the start, they had a policy of censoring nothing except spam. Plus, Reddit had different goals from Hacker News. Reddit was a startup, not a side project; its goal was to grow as fast as possible. Combine rapid growth and zero censorship, and the result is a free-for-all. But I don't think they'd do much differently if they were doing it again. Measured by traffic, Reddit is much more successful than Hacker News."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do user behaviors on online platforms like HN differ based on the community dynamics compared to Reddit?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "User behaviors on online platforms like HN differ based on community dynamics compared to Reddit. What happened to Reddit won't inevitably happen to HN. There are several local maxima. There can be places that are free-for-alls and places that are more thoughtful, just as there are in the real world; and people will behave differently depending on which they're in, just as they do in the real world."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies do some users employ when sharing content on different online platforms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Iâve observed this in the wild. Iâve seen people cross-posting on Reddit and Hacker News who actually took the trouble to write two versions: a flame for Reddit and a more subdued version for HN."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What types of problems does Hacker News aim to prevent in its community?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two major types of problems a site like Hacker News needs to avoid: bad stories and bad comments. So far, the danger of bad stories seems smaller. The stories on the front page now are still roughly the ones that would have been there when HN started."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the quality of content on the frontpage of a voting platform?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I once thought I'd have to weight votes to keep poor content off the front page, but I haven't had to yet. I wouldn't have predicted the front page would hold up so well, and I'm not sure why it has. Perhaps only the more thoughtful users care enough to submit and upvote links, so the marginal cost of one random new user approaches zero. Or perhaps the front page protects itself by advertising what type of submission is expected."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the quality of content that gets upvoted on the frontpage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most dangerous thing for the front page is content that's too easy to upvote. If someone proves a new theorem, it takes some work by the reader to decide whether or not to upvote it. An amusing cartoon takes less effort. A rant with a rallying cry as the title takes zero effort, because people vote it up without even reading it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the Fluff Principle in the context of user-voted news sites?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Fluff Principle refers to the phenomenon on user-voted news sites where the links that are easiest to judge tend to dominate unless specific measures are taken to prevent this outcome."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What measures does Hacker News implement to minimize off-topic content?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hacker News has two kinds of protections against fluff. The most common types of fluff links are banned as off-topic. Pictures of kittens, political diatribes, and so on are explicitly banned. This keeps out most fluff, but not all of it. Some links are both fluff, in the sense of being very short, and also on topic."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria do editors use to evaluate and manage content on a platform related to hacking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's no single solution to that. If a link is just an empty rant, editors will sometimes kill it even if it's on topic in the sense of being about hacking, because it's not on topic by the real standard, which is to engage one's intellectual curiosity. If the posts on a site are characteristically of this type, I sometimes ban it, which means new stuff at that URL is auto-killed. If a post has a linkbait title, editors sometimes rephrase it to be more matter-of-fact. This is especially necessary with links whose titles are rallying cries, because otherwise they become implicit \"vote up if you believe such-and-such\" posts, which are the most extreme form of fluff."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How have aggregators influenced the way writers create content online?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The techniques for dealing with links have to evolve because the links do. The existence of aggregators has already affected what they aggregate. Writers now deliberately write things to draw traffic from aggregatorsâsometimes even specific ones. (No, the irony of this statement is not lost on me.) Then there are the more sinister mutations, like linkjackingâposting a paraphrase of someone else's article and submitting that instead of the original. These can get a lot of upvotes because a lot of what's good in an article often survives; indeed, the closer the paraphrase is to plagiarism, the more survives."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can users of a submission-based site ensure transparency regarding rejected submissions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's important that a site that kills submissions provides a way for users to see what got killed if they want to. That keeps editors honest, and just as importantly, makes users confident they'd know if the editors stopped being honest. HN users can do this by flipping a switch called showdead in their profile."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges does Hacker News face regarding user-generated content?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bad comments seem to be a harder problem than bad submissions. While the quality of links on the front page of HN hasn't changed much, the quality of the median comment may have decreased somewhat."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two main types of negative comments, and how can they be addressed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two main kinds of negativity in comments: meanness and stupidity. There is a lot of overlap between the twoâmean comments are disproportionately likely also to be dumbâbut the strategies for dealing with them are different. Meanness is easier to control. You can have rules stating that one shouldn't be mean, and if you enforce them, it seems possible to keep a lid on meanness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it more challenging to manage or control stupidity compared to meanness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Keeping a lid on stupidity is harder, perhaps because stupidity is not so easily distinguishable. Mean people are more likely to know they're being mean than stupid people are to know they're being stupid."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of comment is considered most harmful in online discussions, and why?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most dangerous form of a stupid comment is not the long but mistaken argument, but the dumb joke. Long but mistaken arguments are actually quite rare. There is a strong correlation between comment quality and length; if you wanted to compare the quality of comments on community sites, average length would be a good predictor. Probably the cause is human nature rather than anything specific to comment threads. It is likely that stupidity more often takes the form of having few ideas than wrong ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common characteristic of stupid comments and how do people try to make them stand out?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whatever the cause, stupid comments tend to be short. Since it's hard to write a short comment that's distinguished for the amount of information it conveys, people try to distinguish them instead by being funny. The most tempting format for stupid comments is the supposedly witty put-down, probably because put-downs are the easiest form of humor."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do negative comments influence the quality of subsequent discussions in online forums?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Negative comments are like kudzu: they take over rapidly. Comments have much more effect on new comments than submissions have on new submissions. If someone submits a lame article, the other submissions don't all become lame. But if someone posts a stupid comment on a thread, that sets the tone for the region around it. People reply to dumb jokes with dumb jokes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can we improve the quality of online discussions and reduce the prevalence of low-quality comments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One potential solution is to add a delay before people can respond to a comment, making the length of the delay inversely proportional to some prediction of its quality. This way, low-quality threads would grow more slowly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary focus of the techniques described for managing online communities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The primary focus of the techniques described for managing online communities is conservative; they are aimed at preserving the character of the site rather than enhancing it. I don't think that's a bias of mine; it's due to the shape of the problem. Hacker News had the good fortune to start out good, so in this case, it's literally a matter of preservation. However, I think this principle would also apply to sites with different origins."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is more important for the quality of a community site, the users or the technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The good things in a community site come from people more than technology; it's mainly in the prevention of bad things that technology comes into play. Technology certainly can enhance discussion; nested comments do, for example. But I'd rather use a site with primitive features and smart, nice users than a more advanced one whose users were idiots."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies can a community site implement to attract and retain a specific subset of users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most important thing a community site can do is attract the kind of people it wants. A site trying to be as big as possible wants to attract everyone. But a site aiming at a particular subset of users has to attract just thoseâand just as importantly, repel everyone else. I've made a conscious effort to do this on HN. The graphic design is as plain as possible, and the site rules discourage dramatic link titles. The goal is that the only thing to interest someone arriving at HN for the first time should be the ideas expressed there."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why can online distractions be more harmful than physical ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An online distraction can be more dangerous than a physical one. If I spent half the day loitering on University Ave, I would notice. I have to walk a mile to get there, and sitting in a cafÃ© feels different from working. However, visiting an online forum takes just a click and feels superficially very much like working. You may be wasting your time, but you're not idle."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential downsides of using Hacker News despite its usefulness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hacker News is definitely useful. I've learned a lot from things I've read on HN. I've written several essays that began as comments there. So I wouldn't want the site to go away. However, I would like to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity. What a disaster that would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site that caused them to waste lots of time. I wish I could be 100% sure that's not a description of HN."}]}

The situation now is like it was with crack in the 1980s: we've invented terribly addictive new things, and we haven't yet evolved ways to protect ourselves from them.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What methods were used to evaluate the effectiveness of user comment scores in determining quality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I tried ranking users by both average and median comment score, and average (with the high score thrown out) seemed to be the more accurate predictor of high quality. Median may be the more accurate predictor of low quality, though."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the reason for the lack of transparency in Digg's frontpage algorithm compared to Reddit's?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Digg is notorious for its lack of transparency. The root of the problem is not that the people running Digg are especially sneaky, but that they use the wrong algorithm for generating their front page. Instead of bubbling up from the bottom as they get more votes, as on Reddit, stories start at the top and get pushed down by new arrivals."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the origins of Digg and Reddit, and how do they differ in their design and functionality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason for the difference is that Digg is derived from Slashdot, while Reddit is derived from Delicious/popular. Digg is Slashdot with voting instead of editors, and Reddit is Delicious/popular with voting instead of bookmarking. You can still see fossils of their origins in their graphic design."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Digg's algorithm and editorial decisions influence the selection of top stories on the platform?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Digg's algorithm is very vulnerable to gaming because any story that makes it onto the front page becomes the new top story. This, in turn, forces Digg to respond with extreme countermeasures. Many startups have some kind of secret about the subterfuges they had to resort to in the early days, and I suspect Digg's is the extent to which the top stories were de facto chosen by human editors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What innovative strategies can be used to reduce repetitive or unproductive comments in online discussions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I suspect most of the techniques for discouraging unproductive comments have yet to be discovered. Xkcd implemented a particularly clever one in its IRC channel: don't allow the same thing twice. Once someone has said \"fail,\" no one can ever say it again. This would penalize short comments especially, because they have less room to avoid collisions in."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a potential solution for managing negative comments in online discussions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You may not have to kill bad comments to solve the problem. Comments at the bottom of a long thread are rarely seen, so it may be enough to incorporate a prediction of quality in the comment sorting algorithm."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do discussions about religion tend to attract more participation than technical discussions, like those about Javascript?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whatâs different about religion is that people donât feel they need to have any particular expertise to have opinions about it. All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can have those. No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one about religion because people feel they have to be over some threshold of expertise to post comments about that. But on religion, everyoneâs an expert."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What parallels can be drawn between politics and religion regarding the expression of opinions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too. Politics, like religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertise for expressing an opinion. All you need is strong convictions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What commonality exists between religion and politics in terms of how they influence people's opinions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Do religion and politics have something in common that explains this similarity? One possible explanation is that they deal with questions that have no definite answers, so there's no back pressure on people's opinions. Since no one can be proven wrong, every opinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly with theirs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence whether a discussion about historical events becomes contentious?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The topics that engage people's identities depend on the individuals involved, not the subject matter itself. For example, a discussion about a battle that included citizens from one or more of the countries involved would probably degenerate into a political argument. However, a discussion today about a battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn't. No one would know which side to be on. Therefore, it's not politics that is the source of the trouble, but identity. When people say a discussion has degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that it has started to be driven mostly by people's identities."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it a mistake to assume that certain questions have no answer due to the passionate debates they provoke?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because the point at which this happens depends on the people rather than the topic, it's a mistake to conclude that because a question tends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer. For example, the question of the relative merits of programming languages often degenerates into a religious war because so many programmers identify as X programmers or Y programmers. This sometimes leads people to conclude the question must be unanswerableâthat all languages are equally good. Obviously, that's false: anything else people make can be well or badly designed; why should this be uniquely impossible for programming languages? And indeed, you can have a fruitful discussion about the relative merits of programming languages, so long as you exclude people who respond from identity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors determine whether a discussion on a particular topic can be productive?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A productive discussion on a particular topic can occur only if it does not engage the identities of any of the participants. What makes politics and religion such minefields is that they engage so many people's identities. However, it is possible to have a useful conversation about these subjects with some individuals. Conversely, there are other topics that might seem harmless, like the relative merits of Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, that you couldn't safely talk about with certain people."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can minimizing personal identity influences lead to improved idea generation and clearer thinking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it's right, is that it explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but how to have better ideas. If people can't think clearly about anything that has become part of their identity, then all other things being equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What effect does a sudden influx of participants in a discussion have on the nature of the conversation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When that happens, it tends to happen fast, like a core going critical. The threshold for participating goes down to zero, which brings in more people. They tend to say incendiary things, which draw more and angrier counterarguments."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the perception of societal changes in the US over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was striking how old-fashioned this sounded.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the importance of educational credentials in determining life outcomes in the US changed over the past 25 years?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The course of people's lives in the US now seems to be determined less by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 years ago. Where you go to college still matters, but not like it used to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What historical significance did academic credentials hold in the selection process for civil service candidates in China?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Judging people by their academic credentials was, in its time, an advance. The practice seems to have begun in China, where, starting in 587, candidates for the imperial civil service had to take an exam on classical literature."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the Chinese civil service exam system in 587 differ from the European approach to civil service testing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Chinese civil service exam system in 587 differed from the European approach to civil service testing in several ways. It was also a test of wealth because the knowledge it tested was so specialized that passing required years of expensive training. However, while wealth was a necessary condition for passing, it was not a sufficient one. By the standards of the rest of the world in 587, the Chinese system was very enlightened. Europeans didn't introduce formal civil service exams until the nineteenth century, and even then, they seem to have been influenced by the Chinese example."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do cram schools influence the transfer of power and wealth between generations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cram schools are, in effect, leaks in a seal. The use of credentials was an attempt to seal off the direct transmission of power between generations, and cram schools represent that power finding holes in the seal. Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into credentials in the next."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between standardized testing and the evolution of educational institutions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's hard to beat this phenomenon because the schools adjust to suit whatever the tests measure. When the tests are narrow and predictable, you get cram schools on the classic model, like those that prepared candidates for Sandhurst (the British West Point) or the classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores. But as the tests get broader, the schools do too. Preparing a candidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years, as prep school does today. But the raison d'Ãªtre of all these institutions has been the same: to beat the system."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does parental influence impact societal prosperity and children's success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "History suggests that, all other things being equal, a society prospers in proportion to its ability to prevent parents from influencing their children's success directly. It's a fine thing for parents to help their children indirectlyâfor example, by helping them to become smarter or more disciplined, which then makes them more successful. The problem comes when parents use direct methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or power as a substitute for their children's qualities."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of diverting parental ambitions from direct methods to focusing on raising their children effectively?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sealing off this force has a double advantage. Not only does a society get \"the best man for the job,\" but parents' ambitions are diverted from direct methods to indirect onesâactually trying to raise their kids well."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it challenging to prevent parents from seeking unfair advantages for their children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is very hard to contain parents' efforts to obtain an unfair advantage for their kids.

We shouldn't expect naive solutions to work, any more than we'd expect naive solutions for keeping heroin out of a prison to work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can society improve its credentialing system to reduce the effectiveness of cram schools?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The obvious way to solve the problem is to make credentials better. If the tests a society uses are currently hackable, we can study the way people beat them and try to plug the holes. You can use the cram schools to show you where most of the holes are. They also tell you when you're succeeding in fixing them: when cram schools become less popular."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can increased transparency in college admissions address the issues of corruption, such as legacy admissions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Increased transparency in college admissions can address issues of corruption, such as legacy admissions. In the US, this process still shows many outward signs of corruption. For example, legacy admissions. The official story is that legacy status doesn't carry much weight because all it does is break ties: applicants are bucketed by ability, and legacy status is only used to decide between the applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff. But what this means is that a university can make legacy status have as much or as little weight as they want by adjusting the size of the bucket that straddles the cutoff."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary purpose of credentials in evaluating individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's think about what credentials are for. What they are, functionally, is a way of predicting performance. If you could measure actual performance, you wouldn't need them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did credentialism emerge as a factor in candidate selection for large organizations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Credentialism emerged as a factor in candidate selection for large organizations because individual performance is hard to measure in such settings. The harder performance is to measure, the more important it becomes to predict it. If an organization could immediately and cheaply measure the performance of recruits, they wouldn't need to examine their credentials; they could take everyone and keep just the good ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the size of organizations in a market impact their approach to evaluating individuals' credentials?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Large organizations can't do this. But a bunch of small organizations in a market can come close. A market takes every organization and keeps just the good ones. As organizations get smaller, this approaches taking every person and keeping just the good ones. So all other things being equal, a society consisting of more, smaller organizations will care less about credentials."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the structure of the US economy influence career paths and the importance of credentials?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The structure of the US economy significantly influences career paths and the importance of credentials. In the past, the US economy was dominated by a few large companies, creating an environment where ambitious individuals sought to join these organizations and climb to the top. In such a culture, credentials matter a lot; an elite pedigree becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy within large organizations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might impressive credentials be less valued in small companies compared to larger organizations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Impressive credentials may be less valued in small companies compared to larger organizations because, in small companies, performance is critical. Even if your colleagues are initially impressed by your credentials, they would soon part ways with you if your performance didn't match expectations. This is because the company relies heavily on each individual's contributions to survive, and poor performance could lead to the business going out of operation, resulting in everyone being dispersed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors are driving the shift in hiring priorities from credentials to performance in today's job market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In a world of small companies, performance is all anyone cares about. People hiring for a startup don't care whether you've even graduated from college, let alone which one. All they care about is what you can do, which is in fact all that should matter, even in a large organization. The reason credentials have such prestige is that for so long the large organizations in a society tended to be the most powerful. But in the U.S. at least, they don't have the monopoly on power they once did, precisely because they can't measure (and thus reward) individual performance. Why spend twenty years climbing the corporate ladder when you can get rewarded directly by the market?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of evaluating talent shifted in the past 25 years?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I realize I see a more exaggerated version of the change than most other people. As a partner at an early-stage venture funding firm, I'm like a jumpmaster shoving people out of the old world of credentials and into the new one of performance. I'm an agent of the change I'm seeing. But I don't think I'm imagining it. It was not so easy 25 years ago for an ambitious person to choose to be judged directly by the market. You had to go through bosses, and they were influenced by where you'd been to college."}]}

My friend Julian Weber told me that when he went to work for a New York law firm in the 1950s, they paid associates far less than firms do today. Law firms then made no pretense of paying people according to the value of the work they had done; pay was based on seniority. Younger employees were expected to pay their dues, with the promise of rewards later."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the rise of high salaries for young professionals in the 1980s?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The rise of high salaries for young professionals in the 1980s can be attributed to several factors. One reason was the skepticism about working to accumulate deferred rewards at companies that might go bankrupt or be taken over, which could wipe out their implicit obligations. Additionally, some companies broke ranks and began paying young employees large amounts, particularly in consulting, law, and finance. This led to the phenomenon of \"yuppies.\" While the term is rarely used today, as it is no longer surprising to see a 25-year-old with money, in 1985, the sight of a 25-year-old earning a high salary was notable."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of companies did the classic yuppie typically work for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The classic yuppie worked for a small organization.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the emergence of startups and yuppies in the late 1970s and early 1980s?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups and yuppies entered the American conceptual vocabulary roughly simultaneously in the late 1970s and early 1980s. I don't think there was a causal connection. Startups happened because technology started to change so fast that big companies could no longer keep a lid on the smaller ones. I don't think the rise of yuppies was inspired by it; it seems more as if there was a change in the social conventions (and perhaps the laws) governing the way big companies worked. But the two phenomena rapidly fused to produce a principle that now seems obvious: paying energetic young people market rates and getting correspondingly high performance from them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the introduction of performance-based pay in certain sectors influence overall economic behavior and wage standards?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The introduction of performance-based pay in certain sectors can significantly influence overall economic behavior and wage standards. All it takes is a few beachheads in your economy that pay for performance. Measurement spreads like heat. If one part of a society is better at measurement than others, it tends to push the others to do better. If young, smart, and driven individuals can make more by starting their own companies than by working for existing ones, the existing companies are forced to pay more to keep them. Thus, market rates gradually permeate every organization, even the government."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might the current recession impact the number of new startups and venture capital funding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "VC funding will probably dry up somewhat during the present recession, like it usually does in bad times. But this time, the result may be different. The number of new startups may not decrease, and that could be dangerous for VCs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the relationship between venture capital funding and startup creation changed since the Internet Bubble?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When VC funding dried up after the Internet Bubble, startups dried up too. There were not a lot of new startups being founded in 2003. But startups aren't tied to VC the way they were 10 years ago. It's now possible for VCs and startups to diverge. And if they do, they may not reconverge once the economy gets better."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors have contributed to the decreased reliance of startups on venture capital funding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason startups no longer depend so much on VCs is one that everyone in the startup business knows by now: it has gotten much cheaper to start a startup. There are four main reasons: Moore's law has made hardware cheap; open source has made software free; the web has made marketing and distribution free; and more powerful programming languages mean development teams can be smaller. These changes have pushed the cost of starting a startup down into the noise. In a lot of startupsâprobably most startups funded by Y Combinatorâthe biggest expense is simply the founders' living expenses. We've had startups that were profitable on revenues of $3,000 a month."}]}

For example, though the stock market crash does seem to have made investors more cautious, it doesn't seem to have had any effect on the number of people who want to start startups. We take applications for funding every six months. Applications for the current funding cycle closed on October 17, well after the markets tanked, and even so, we got a record number, up 40% from the same cycle a year before."}]}

While there may be concerns about the economy worsening in the future, there is currently no slackening of interest among potential founders. In 2001, there was a widespread feeling among aspiring entrepreneurs that startups were over, and many opted to pursue graduate school instead. This time, however, that sentiment is absent. One reason for this is that even in a bad economy, it is not particularly difficult to build something that generates $3,000 a month. If investors stop writing checks, many founders feel it is not a significant concern."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What sentiment are some YC founders expressing about working with investors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've detected this \"investors aren't worth the trouble\" vibe from several YC founders I've talked to recently.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact has Y Combinator's initial investment had on the success of startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Y Combinator's initial investment of $15,000 has allowed some startups to achieve profitability, and they hope not to need more funding. This outcome surprised even us. Although YC is based on the idea that it is cheap to start a startup, we never anticipated that founders would grow successful startups on nothing more than YC funding."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the founder community influence trends in technology and funding among startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is a founder community just as there's a VC community. They all know one another, and techniques spread rapidly between them. If one tries a new programming language or a new hosting provider and gets good results, six months later, half of them are using it. The same is true for funding.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factor has historically contributed to the success of societies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For nearly all of history, the success of a society was proportionate to its ability to assemble large and disciplined organizations. Those who bet on economies of scale generally won, which meant the largest organizations were the most successful ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of large organizations compared to small businesses changed over the decades?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Things have already changed so much that this is hard for us to believe, but until just a few decades ago, the largest organizations tended to be the most progressive. An ambitious kid graduating from college in 1960 wanted to work in the huge, gleaming offices of Ford, General Electric, or NASA. Small meant small-time. Small in 1960 didn't mean a cool little startup; it meant Uncle Sid's shoe store."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the prevailing career aspiration for young people in the 1970s?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I grew up in the 1970s, the idea of the \"corporate ladder\" was still very much alive. The standard plan was to try to get into a good college, from which one would be drafted into some organization and then rise to positions of gradually increasing responsibility. The more ambitious merely hoped to climb the same ladder faster."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What shift occurred in the late twentieth century regarding the advantages of size versus speed in technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the late twentieth century, something changed. It turned out that economies of scale were not the only force at work. Particularly in technology, the increase in speed one could achieve from smaller groups started to trump the advantages of size."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the vision of the future changed since 1970 in terms of societal structure and technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The future turned out to be different from the one we were expecting in 1970. The domed cities and flying cars we expected have failed to materialize. But fortunately, so have the jumpsuits with badges indicating our specialty and rank. Instead of being dominated by a few giant, tree-structured organizations, it's now looking like the economy of the future will be a fluid network of smaller, independent units."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the rapid pace of technological change affected the effectiveness of large organizations in competition?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not so much that large organizations stopped working. There's no evidence that famously successful organizations like the Roman army or the British East India Company were any less afflicted by protocol and politics than organizations of the same size today. But they were competing against opponents who couldn't change the rules on the fly by discovering new technology. Now it turns out the rule \"large and disciplined organizations win\" needs to have a qualification appended: \"at games that change slowly.\" No one knew until change reached a sufficient speed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors are influencing ambitious college graduates to avoid traditional big companies in favor of startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ambitious college graduates today are increasingly avoiding traditional big companies in favor of startups. For the first time in history, these graduates are no longer drawn to the stability of large corporations. Instead, they are attracted to the excitement and rapid growth potential of hot startups. If they are particularly ambitious, they may even aspire to start their own companies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do startups impact the existence of big companies in the business landscape?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This doesn't mean big companies will disappear. To say that startups will succeed implies that big companies will exist because startups that succeed either become big companies or are acquired by them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies can ambitious individuals use to capitalize on outdated ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ambitious individuals can capitalize on outdated ideas that are now obsolete but extremely deeply rooted. This means they can engage in arbitrage on these ideas. It will be very valuable to understand precisely which ideas to keep and which can now be discarded."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the rarity of educated individuals starting their own businesses before the rise of technology and Internet startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There have always been occasional cases, particularly in the US, of ambitious people who grew the ladder under them instead of climbing it. But until recently, this was an anomalous route that tended to be followed only by outsiders. It was no coincidence that the great industrialists of the nineteenth century had so little formal education. As huge as their companies eventually became, they were all essentially mechanics and shopkeepers at first. That was a social step no one with a college education would take if they could avoid it. Until the rise of technology startups, and in particular, Internet startups, it was very unusual for educated people to start their own businesses."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What led the founders of Fairchild Semiconductor to start their own company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The eight men who left Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild Semiconductor, the original Silicon Valley startup, weren't even trying to start a company at first. They were just looking for a company willing to hire them as a group. Then one of their parents introduced them to a small investment bank that offered to find funding for them to start their own, so they did. However, starting a company was an alien idea to them; it was something they backed into."}]}

East Coast universities are not far behind, and British universities only a little behind them. This pattern suggests that attitudes at Stanford and Berkeley are not an anomaly, but a leading indicator. This is the way the world is going."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can innovations in technology lead to significant economic growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Innovations in technology can lead to significant economic growth because there seems to be no limit to the amount of work that can be done in this area. Like science, wealth appears to expand fractally. Steam power was a small part of the British economy when Watt started working on it, but his efforts led to more work until that small segment expanded into something larger than the entire economy of which it had initially been a part."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact could ambitious individuals starting Internet startups have on the economy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If Internet startups offer the best opportunity for ambitious people, then a lot of ambitious individuals will start them, and this part of the economy will balloon in the usual fractal way."}]}

The most dynamic part of the economy always does, in everything from salaries to standards of dress. Not just because of its prestige, but because the principles underlying the most dynamic part of the economy tend to be ones that work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of organizational structure is predicted to be most successful in the future?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For the future, the trend to bet on seems to be networks of small, autonomous groups whose performance is measured individually.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influenced the spread of the Industrial Revolution across different societies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As with the original Industrial Revolution, some societies are going to be better at this than others. Within a generation of its birth in England, the Industrial Revolution had spread to continental Europe and North America. However, it didn't spread everywhere. This new way of doing things could only take root in places that were prepared for it. It could only spread to places that already had a vigorous middle class."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact did the transformation in Silicon Valley in the 1960s have on the development of integrated circuits and startup companies globally?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is a similar social component to the transformation that began in Silicon Valley in the 1960s. Two new kinds of techniques were developed there: techniques for building integrated circuits and techniques for building a new type of company designed to grow fast by creating new technology. The techniques for building integrated circuits spread rapidly to other countries, but the techniques for building startups didn't. Fifty years later, startups are ubiquitous in Silicon Valley and common in a handful of other U.S. cities, but they're still an anomaly in most of the world."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the limited spread of startups compared to the Industrial Revolution?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Part of the reasonâpossibly the main reasonâthat startups have not spread as broadly as the Industrial Revolution did is their social disruptiveness. Though it brought many social changes, the Industrial Revolution was not fighting the principle that bigger is better. Quite the opposite: the two dovetailed beautifully. The new industrial companies adapted the customs of existing large organizations like the military and the civil service, and the resulting hybrid worked well. \"Captains of industry\" issued orders to \"armies of workers,\" and everyone knew what they were supposed to do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do startups struggle to thrive in certain social environments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups seem to go more against the grain socially. It's hard for them to flourish in societies that value hierarchy and stability, just as it was hard for industrialization to flourish in societies ruled by people who stole at will from the merchant class. However, there were already a handful of countries past that stage when the Industrial Revolution happened. There do not seem to be that many ready this time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key difference in operational approaches between big companies and startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the differences between big companies and startups is that big companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselves against mistakes. A startup walks like a toddler, bashing into things and falling over all the time. A big company is more deliberate."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do organizations learn from past disasters to improve their supplier selection process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind of learning based on disasters that have happened to it or others like it. After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt and fails to deliver, for example, a company might require all suppliers to prove they are solvent before submitting bids."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the increase in disaster preparedness checks within growing companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As companies grow, they invariably get more such checks, either in response to disasters they've suffered or, probably more often, by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with them customs for protecting against new types of disasters."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common oversight when organizations implement new checks to prevent mistakes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's natural for organizations to learn from mistakes. The problem is that people who propose new checks almost never consider that the check itself has a cost."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the hidden costs associated with requiring suppliers to verify their solvency?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, consider the case of making suppliers verify their solvency. Surely that's mere prudence? But in fact, it could have substantial costs. There's obviously the direct cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and check proofs of the supplier's solvency. But the real costs are the ones you never hear about: the company that would be the best supplier but doesn't bid because they can't spare the effort to get verified. Or the company that would be the best supplier but falls just short of the threshold for solvencyâwhich will, of course, have been set on the high side since there is no apparent cost of increasing it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should be considered when proposing a new check in an organization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whenever someone in an organization proposes to add a new check, they should have to explain not just the benefit but the cost. No matter how poorly they analyze it, this meta-check would at least remind everyone that there had to be a consideration of both aspects."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What pricing strategy should software vendors consider when selling to corporate customers to avoid the high costs of the approval process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If companies started doing that, they'd find some surprises. Joel Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software to corporate customers. He said that in most companies, software costing up to about $1,000 could be bought by individual managers without any additional approvals. Above that threshold, software purchases generally had to be approved by a committee. However, babysitting this process was so expensive for software vendors that it didn't make sense to charge less than $50,000. This means if you're making something you might otherwise have charged $5,000 for, you have to sell it for $50,000 instead."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do checks on purchases tend to be costly and lead to inefficiency in the market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Checks on purchases tend to be costly because the harder it is to sell something to you, the more it has to cost. And not merely linearly, either. If you're hard enough to sell to, the people who are best at making things don't want to bother. The only people who will sell to you are companies that specialize in selling to you. Then you've sunk to a whole new level of inefficiency. Market mechanisms no longer protect you because the good suppliers are no longer in the market."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can government restrictions impact a country's economic development and global influence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Government restrictions can significantly impact a country's economic development and global influence. Such things happen constantly to the biggest organizations of all, governments. However, checks instituted by governments can cause much worse problems than merely overpaying. These restrictions can cripple a country's whole economy. Up until about 1400, China was richer and more technologically advanced than Europe. One reason Europe pulled ahead was that the Chinese government restricted long trading voyages. As a result, it was left to the Europeans to explore and eventually dominate the rest of the world, including China."}]}

That wasn't the intention of the legislators who wrote it; they just wanted to add a few more checks on public companies. However, they forgot to consider the cost. They overlooked that companies about to go public are usually rather stretched, and that the weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for General Electric to bear is enough to prevent younger companies from being public at all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates programmers to write and release more code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Programmers, though, like it better when they write more code. Or, more precisely, when they release more code. Programmers like to make a differenceâgood ones, anyway."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantages do good programmers experience when working at a startup compared to larger companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For good programmers, one of the best things about working for a startup is that there are few checks on releases. In true startups, there are no external checks at all. If you have an idea for a new feature in the morning, you can write it and push it to the production servers before lunch. When you can do that, you have more ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do programmers face when transitioning from a startup to a big company regarding software release timelines?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At big companies, software has to go through various approvals before it can be launched. The cost of doing this can be enormousâin fact, discontinuous. I was talking recently to a group of three programmers whose startup had been acquired a few years before by a big company. When they had been independent, they could release changes instantly. Now, they said, the absolute fastest they could get code released on the production servers was two weeks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the potential consequence of imposing excessive checks on programmers in a hiring context?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Just as the greatest danger of being hard to sell to is not that you overpay, but that the best suppliers won't even sell to you, the greatest danger of applying too many checks to your programmers is not that you'll make them unproductive, but that good programmers won't even want to work for you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to allow artists to ship their work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Steve Jobs's famous maxim \"artists ship\" works both ways. Artists aren't merely capable of shipping; they insist on it. So, if you don't let people ship, you won't have any artists."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key challenge of relying on your business revenues for personal income?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One disadvantage of living off the revenues of your company is that you have to keep running it. As anyone who runs their own business can tell you, that requires your complete attention. You can't just start a business and check out once things are going well, or they stop going well surprisingly fast."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the primary economic motivations of startup founders, and how do these motivations contrast with the realities of running a business?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main economic motives of startup founders seem to be freedom and security. They want enough money that (a) they don't have to worry about running out of money and (b) they can spend their time how they want. Running your own business offers neither. You certainly don't have freedom; no boss is so demanding. Nor do you have security, because if you stop paying attention to the company, its revenues go away, and with them your income."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential benefits of hiring a manager for a growing business?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best case, for most people, would be if you could hire someone to manage the company for you once you'd grown it to a certain size. Suppose you could find a really good manager. Then you would have both freedom and security. You could pay as little attention to the business as you wanted, knowing that your manager would keep things running smoothly. And, that being so, revenues would continue to flow in, so you'd have security as well."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might some founders struggle to align their personal interests with customer needs in their business?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some founders might struggle to align their personal interests with customer needs because they are so passionate about running their company that they prioritize their own desires over the demands of the market. However, this group is likely small. To succeed in most businesses, one must be fanatically attentive to customers' needs. What are the odds that your own desires would coincide exactly with the demands of this powerful, external force?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should founders consider doing with their company as it grows?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As the company grows, founders should consider eventually handing it over to a professional manager, provided they can find one who is competent enough to take on the role."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the benefit of having a management company instead of relying on an individual manager?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Having a management company instead of relying on an individual manager has significant benefits. For instance, what if your manager was hit by a bus? With a management company, you ensure that your operations continue smoothly without depending on any one person."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How could a management company structure its ownership and profit distribution among the companies it manages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A management company could be organized in a straightforward manner. The simplest way would be to have a new kind of stock representing the total pool of companies they manage. When a company signs up, it would trade its stock for shares of this pool, in proportion to an estimate of its value that both parties have agreed upon. Then, the company would automatically receive its share of the returns from the whole pool."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How could management companies enable clients to change their investment strategies more flexibly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The catch is that because this kind of trade would be hard to undo, you couldn't switch management companies. But there's a way they could fix that: suppose all the management companies got together and agreed to allow their clients to exchange shares in all their pools. Then you could, in effect, simultaneously choose all the management companies to run yours for you, in whatever proportion you wanted, and change your mind later as often as you wanted."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Should startups prioritize charging customers or focus on product development initially?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups should try charging customers right away. Yet, some of the most successful startups, including Google, ignored revenue at first and concentrated exclusively on development. The answer probably depends on the type of company you're starting. I can imagine some where trying to make sales would be a good heuristic for product design, and others where it would just be a distraction. The test is probably whether it helps you to understand your users."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of profitability in determining a revenue strategy for a new company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Profitability is crucial in determining a revenue strategy for a new company because it allows you to choose whichever revenue strategy you think is best for the type of company you're starting. Being profitable ensures you'll get at least the average of the acquisition market, in which public companies behave as pooled-risk management companies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between starting a company to generate revenue and the option of selling it for profit?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "David isn't mistaken in saying you should start a company to live off its revenues.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do attitudes toward wealth and influence differ between New York and Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's not quite the same message New York sends. Power matters in New York too, of course, but New York is pretty impressed by a billion dollars even if you merely inherited it. In Silicon Valley, no one would care except a few real estate agents. What matters in Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world.

Empirically, the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you had enough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be able to transcend your environment. Where you live should make at most a couple percent difference. But if you look at the historical evidence, it seems to matter more than that. Most people who did great things were clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing was done at the time."}]}

But when I finally tried living there a couple of years ago, it turned out not to be. The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better. Life in Berkeley is very civilized. It's probably the place in America where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home. But it's not humming with ambition."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates people to choose to live in Cambridge despite its high cost and poor weather?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In retrospect, it shouldn't have been surprising that a place so pleasant would attract people interested above all in quality of life. Cambridge, with good weather, it turns out, is not Cambridge. The people you find in Cambridge are not there by accident. You have to make sacrifices to live there. It's expensive and somewhat grubby, and the weather's often bad. So the kind of people you find in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where the smartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive, grubby place with bad weather."}]}

When you walk through Palo Alto in the evening, you see nothing but the blue glow of TVs. In Cambridge, you see shelves full of promising-looking books. Palo Alto was probably much like Cambridge in 1960, but you'd never guess now that there was a university nearby. Now it's just one of the richer neighborhoods in Silicon Valley."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unique aspects of living in Cambridge contribute to the experience of understanding the city's character?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A city speaks to you mostly by accident â in things you see through windows, in conversations you overhear. It's not something you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off. One of the occupational hazards of living in Cambridge is overhearing the conversations of people who use interrogative intonation in declarative sentences.

At the time, I thought she was being deliberately eccentric. Sure, it can be interesting to eavesdrop on people, but is good quality eavesdropping so important that it would affect where you chose to live? Now I understand what she meant.

Most people overvalue negative amounts of money; theyâll work much harder to avoid losing a dollar than to gain one.

There's an A-list of people who are most in demand right now, and what's most admired is to be on it or friends with those who are. Beneath that, the message is much like New York's, though perhaps with more emphasis on physical attractiveness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors determine social status and influence in Washington, DC compared to Los Angeles?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In DC, the message seems to be that the most important thing is who you know. You want to be an insider. In practice, this seems to work much as in LA. There's an A List, and you want to be on it or close to those who are. The only difference is how the A List is selected. And even that is not that different."}]}

But this will change if enough startups choose SF over the Valley. During the Bubble, that was a predictor of failure â a self-indulgent choice, like buying expensive office furniture. Even now, I'm suspicious when startups choose SF. But if enough good ones do, it stops being a self-indulgent choice because the center of gravity of Silicon Valley will shift there."}]}

If you listen for it, you can also hear it in Paris, New York, and Boston. But this message is everywhere very faint. It would have been strong 100 years ago, but now I probably wouldn't have picked it up at all if I hadn't deliberately tuned in to that wavelength to see if there was any signal left."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on ambition when considering its various manifestations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My immediate reaction to this list is that it makes me slightly queasy. I'd always considered ambition a good thing, but I realize now that was because I'd always implicitly understood it to mean ambition in the areas I cared about. When you list everything ambitious people are ambitious about, it's not so pretty."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of physical attractiveness as a desirable trait evolved for men over the past century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "On closer examination, I see a couple of things on the list that are surprising in light of history. For example, physical attractiveness wouldn't have been there 100 years ago (though it might have been 2400 years ago). It has always mattered for women, but in the late twentieth century, it seems to have started to matter for men as well. I'm not sure why â probably some combination of the increasing power of women, the increasing influence of actors as models, and the fact that so many people work in offices now: you can't show off by wearing clothes too fancy to wear in a factory, so you have to show off with your body instead."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the concept of hipness evolved in relation to social class and cultural understanding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hipness is another concept you wouldn't have seen on the list 100 years ago. Or wouldn't you? What it means is to know what's what. So maybe it has simply replaced the component of social class that consisted of being \"au fait.\" That could explain why hipness seems particularly admired in London: it's a version 2 of the traditional English delight in obscure codes that only insiders understand."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the concept of economic power evolved over the past century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Economic power would have been on the list 100 years ago, but what we mean by it is changing. It used to mean the control of vast human and material resources. But increasingly, it means the ability to direct the course of technology, and some of the people in a position to do that are not even rich â leaders of important open-source projects, for example. The Captains of Industry of times past had laboratories full of clever people cooking up new technologies for them. The new breed are themselves those people."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are cities less important for networking in fields like math and physics compared to other disciplines?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What cities provide is an audience and a funnel for peers. These aren't so critical in something like math or physics, where no audience matters except your peers, and judging ability is sufficiently straightforward that hiring and admissions committees can do it reliably. In a field like math or physics, all you need is a department with the right colleagues in it. It could be anywhere â in Los Alamos, New Mexico, for example."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the environment particularly important for practitioners in fields like the arts, writing, and technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fields like the arts, writing, and technology, the larger environment matters significantly. In these areas, the best practitioners aren't conveniently collected in a few top university departments and research labsâpartly because talent is harder to judge, and partly because people pay for these things, so one doesn't need to rely on teaching or research funding to support oneself. It's in these more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city: you need the encouragement of feeling that people around you care about the kind of work you do, and since you have to find peers for yourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a great city."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the social environment important for artists progressing in their careers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The social environment is important for artists progressing in their careers because it provides a space where they can find peers and encouragement. It is often during the transition to more challenging stages in their work that this support becomes crucial. Artists seem to be able to leave their initial environments once they have found both community and inspiration. The Impressionists exemplify this pattern: they were born all over France (Pissarro was born in the Caribbean) and died all over France, but what defined them were the years they spent together in Paris."}]}

You can never tell what message a city sends until you live there, or even whether it still sends one.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do ambitious individuals often discover their true career paths?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some people know at 16 what sort of work they're going to do, but in most ambitious kids, ambition seems to precede anything specific to be ambitious about. They know they want to do something great; they just haven't decided yet whether they're going to be a rock star or a brain surgeon. There's nothing wrong with that. But it means if you have this most common type of ambition, you'll probably have to figure out where to live by trial and error. You'll probably have to find the city where you feel at home to know what sort of ambition you have."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of having independent universities not controlled by the government?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the advantages of having universities in your country that are not controlled by the government is that when governments decide how to allocate resources, political deal-making causes things to be spread out geographically. No central government would put its two best universities in the same town unless it was the capital (which would cause other problems). However, scholars seem to like to cluster together, just as people in any other field do, and when given the freedom to do so, they derive the same advantages from it."}]}

Who continued to dress in jeans and t-shirts, to drive the old car they had in grad school, and so on? If you did that in New York, people would treat you like shit. If you walk into a fancy restaurant in San Francisco wearing jeans and a t-shirt, they're nice to you; who knows who you might be? Not in New York."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the number of restaurants requiring jackets for men indicate about a city's status as a technology hub?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One sign of a city's potential as a technology center is the number of restaurants that still require jackets for men.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is New York considered the center of the art business despite Paris's reputation for artistic appreciation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If Paris is where people care most about art, why is New York the center of gravity of the art business? Because in the twentieth century, art as brand split apart from art as stuff. New York is where the richest buyers are, but all they demand from art is brand, and since you can base brand on anything with a sufficiently identifiable style, you may as well use the local stuff."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can seemingly harmless activities like browsing the Internet lead to increased distractions and decreased productivity over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "After years of carefully avoiding classic time sinks like TV, games, and Usenet, I still managed to fall prey to distraction because I didn't realize that it evolves. Something that used to be safe, using the Internet, gradually became more and more dangerous. Some days I'd wake up, get a cup of tea, and check the news, then check email, then check the news again, then answer a few emails, and then suddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn't gotten any real work done. And this started to happen more and more often."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the author come to about the impact of the Internet on their productivity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It took me surprisingly long to realize how distracting the Internet had become because the problem was intermittent. I ignored it the way you let yourself ignore a bug that only appears intermittently. When I was in the middle of a project, distractions weren't really a problem. It was when I finished one project and was deciding what to do next that they always bit me."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why was it difficult for people to recognize the risks associated with excessive Internet use?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another reason it was hard to notice the danger of this new type of distraction was that social customs hadn't yet caught up with it. If I had spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa watching TV, I would have noticed very quickly. That's a known danger sign, like drinking alone. But using the Internet still looked and felt a lot like work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What prompted the author to change their approach to using the Internet?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Eventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so much more distracting that I had to start treating it differently.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did the author face in trying to limit their Internet usage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At first, I tried rules. For example, I'd tell myself I was only going to use the Internet twice a day. But these schemes never worked for long. Eventually, something would come up that required me to use it more than that.

And this turns out to be enough. When I have to sit on the other side of the room to check email or browse the web, I become much more aware of it. Sufficiently aware, in my case at least, that it's hard to spend more than about an hour a day online."}]}

All adults know what their culture lies to kids about: they're the questions you answer with \"Ask your parents.\" If a kid asked who won the World Series in 1982 or what the atomic weight of carbon was, you could just tell him. But if a kid asks you, \"Is there a God?\" or \"What's a prostitute?\" you'll probably say, \"Ask your parents.\""}]}

The consequence was a positively fanatic freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do adults often feel the need to lie to children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you ask adults why they lie to kids, the most common reason they give is to protect them.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can overprotective parenting negatively impact a teenager's understanding of the world?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Imagine if you tried to keep someone in as protected an environment as a newborn until age 18. To mislead someone so grossly about the world would seem not protection but abuse. That's an extreme example, of course; when parents do that sort of thing, it becomes national news. But you see the same problem on a smaller scale in the malaise teenagers feel in suburbia."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the perceived advantages and disadvantages of growing up in suburbia?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environment for children to grow up in. It seems great for 10-year-olds. I liked living in suburbia when I was 10. I didn't notice how sterile it was. My whole world was no bigger than a few friends' houses I bicycled to and some woods I ran around in. On a log scale, I was midway between crib and globe. A suburban street was just the right size. But as I grew older, suburbia started to feel suffocatingly fake."}]}

A friend who moved out of Manhattan said merely that her 3-year-old daughter \"saw too much.\" Off the top of my head, that might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness, gruesome medical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees of oddness, and violent anger."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What concerns might a parent have about exposing a young child to adult conflicts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's the anger that would worry me most if I had a 3-year-old. I was 29 when I moved to New York, and I was surprised even then. I wouldn't want a 3-year-old to see some of the disputes I saw; it would be too frightening. A lot of the things adults conceal from smaller children, they conceal because they'd be frightening, not because they want to conceal the existence of such things. Misleading the child is just a byproduct."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some common misconceptions that parents may unintentionally instill in their children as they grow up?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This seems one of the most justifiable types of lying adults do to kids. But because the lies are indirect, we don't keep a very strict accounting of them. Parents know they've concealed the facts about sex, and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more. However, few tell their kids about the differences between the real world and the cocoon they grew up in. Combine this with the confidence parents try to instill in their kids, and every year you get a new crop of 18-year-olds who think they know how to run the world."}]}

Actually, this seems to be a recent innovation, no more than about 100 years old. In preindustrial times, teenage kids were junior members of the adult world and comparatively well aware of their shortcomings. They could see they weren't as strong or skillful as the village smith. In past times, people lied to kids about some things more than we do now, but the lies implicit in an artificial, protected environment are a recent invention. Like a lot of new inventions, the rich got this first. Children of kings and great magnates were the first to grow up out of touch with the world. Suburbia means half the population can live like kings in that respect."}]}

Iâd worry less about what theyâd see and more about what theyâd do. I went to college with a lot of kids who grew up in Manhattan, and as a rule, they seemed pretty jaded.

Their dislike of the idea is so visceral it's probably inborn. But if it's inborn, it should be universal, and there are plenty of societies where parents don't mind if their teenage kids have sexâindeed, where it's normal for 14-year-olds to become mothers. So what's going on? There does seem to be a universal taboo against sex with prepubescent children. One can imagine evolutionary reasons for that. I think this is the main reason parents in industrialized societies dislike teenage kids having sex. They still think of them as children, even though biologically they're not, so the taboo against child sex still has force."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What risks are associated with the pursuit of pleasure from sex and drugs, particularly among teenagers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One thing adults conceal about sex, they also conceal about drugs: that it can cause great pleasure. That's what makes sex and drugs so dangerous. The desire for them can cloud one's judgmentâwhich is especially frightening when the judgment being clouded is the already wretched judgment of a teenage kid."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some parents discourage their children from having sex?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another reason parents don't want their kids having sex is that they want to keep them innocent. Adults have a certain model of how kids are supposed to behave, and it's different from what they expect of other adults."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key difference in language use between adults and children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most obvious differences is the words kids are allowed to use. Most parents use words when talking to other adults that they wouldn't want their kids using. They try to hide even the existence of these words for as long as they can. And this is another of those conspiracies everyone participates in: everyone knows you're not supposed to swear in front of kids."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do parents often find it appealing to preserve the innocence and mispronunciations of their young children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason parents often find it appealing to preserve the innocence of their young children is that we are programmed to like certain kinds of helplessness. I have several times heard mothers say they deliberately refrained from correcting their young children's mispronunciations because they were so cute. If you think about it, cuteness is a form of helplessness. Toys and cartoon characters meant to be cute always have clueless expressions and stubby, ineffectual limbs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for children to maintain a sense of innocence as they learn about the world?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Innocence is also open-mindedness. We want kids to be innocent so they can continue to learn. Paradoxical as it sounds, there are some kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds of knowledge. If you're going to learn that the world is a brutal place full of people trying to take advantage of one another, you're better off learning it last. Otherwise, you won't bother learning much more."}]}

Sex, I believe, is concealed because of deep taboos. But why do we conceal death from kids? Probably because small children are particularly horrified by it. They want to feel safe, and death is the ultimate threat."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What elaborate story did the narrator's parents create about the death of their first cat?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most spectacular lies our parents told us was about the death of our first cat. Over the years, as we asked for more details, they were compelled to invent more, so the story grew quite elaborate. The cat had died at the vet's office. Of what? Of the anesthesia itself. Why was the cat at the vet's office? To be fixed. And why had such a routine operation killed it? It wasn't the vet's fault; the cat had a congenitally weak heart; the anesthesia was too much for it; but there was no way anyone could have known this in advance. It was not until we were in our twenties that the truth came out: my sister, then about three, had accidentally stepped on the cat and broken its back."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the author's parents approach discussions about death and the afterlife with their children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They didn't feel the need to tell us that the cat was now happily in cat heaven.

She said they'd been sitting reading one day, and when she said something to him, he didn't answer. He seemed to be asleep, but when she tried to rouse him, she couldn't. \"He was gone.\" Having a heart attack sounded like falling asleep.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do children often prefer to believe comforting falsehoods about their world?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "On this topic, especially, they're met halfway by kids.

Almost anything else you tell a kid, they can change their mind about later when they start to think for themselves.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do parents' religious choices influence their children's identity formation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Parents' religious choices can significantly influence their children's identity formation. When parents are of different religions, they often agree between themselves that their children will be \"raised as Xes.\" This approach works; the children grow up considering themselves as Xes, despite the fact that if their parents had chosen differently, they would have grown up considering themselves as Ys."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some reasons adults hide their flaws from children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most adults make some effort to conceal their flaws from children. Usually, their motives are mixed. For example, a father who has an affair generally conceals it from his children. His motive is partly that it would worry them, partly that this would introduce the topic of sex, and partly (a larger part than he would admit) that he doesn't want to tarnish himself in their eyes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the behavior of adults influence children's self-perception and feelings of guilt?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Adults often conceal their flaws while insisting on high standards of behavior for children. As a result, many kids grow up feeling that they fall hopelessly short. They walk around feeling horribly guilty for having used a swear word, while in fact, most of the adults around them are engaging in much worse behavior."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some people feel compelled to provide answers even when they don't know them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This happens in intellectual as well as moral questions. The more confident people are, the more willing they seem to be to answer a question with \"I don't know.\" Less confident people feel they have to have an answer or they'll look bad. My parents were pretty good about admitting when they didn't know things, but I must have been told a lot of lies of this type by teachers because I rarely heard a teacher say \"I don't know\" until I got to college. I remember because it was so surprising to hear someone say that in front of a class."}]}

There are some sterling exceptions, but as a rule, people planning to go into teaching rank academically near the bottom of the college population.

The lies are rarely overt; usually, they consist either of omissions or of over-emphasizing certain topics at the expense of others. The view of history we got in elementary school was a crude hagiography, with at least one representative of each powerful group."}]}

I wonder if it wouldn't have been better just to tell us the truth: that there weren't any famous black scientists. Ranking George Washington Carver with Einstein misled us not only about science but about the obstacles blacks faced in his time."}]}

By the time you got to politics and recent history, what we were taught was pretty much pure propaganda. For example, we were taught to regard political leaders as saintsâespecially the recently martyred Kennedy and King. It was astonishing to learn later that they'd both been serial womanizers and that Kennedy was a speed freak to boot. (By the time King's plagiarism emerged, I'd lost the ability to be surprised by the misdeeds of famous people.)"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do adults often lie to children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Often, when we lie to people, it's not part of any conscious strategy, but because they'd react violently to the truth.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can early experiences and parental reassurances shape our perception of environmental issues?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One consequence of this sort of calming lie is that we grow up thinking horrible things are normal. It's hard for us to feel a sense of urgency as adults over something we've literally been trained not to worry about. When I was about 10, I saw a documentary on pollution that put me into a panic. It seemed the planet was being irretrievably ruined. I went to my mother afterward to ask if this was so. I don't remember what she said, but she made me feel better, so I stopped worrying about it."}]}

However, this process builds up waste products that ultimately require extra oxygen to break down, so at the end of the race, he has to stop and pant for a while to recover."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do small children's perception of time affect their understanding of life and mortality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As a friend with small children pointed out, it's easy for small children to consider themselves immortal because time seems to pass so slowly for them. To a 3-year-old, a day feels like a month might to an adult. So, 80 years sounds to him like 2,400 years would to us."}]}

Usually, people skirt that issue with some equivocation, implying that lies believed for a sufficiently long time by sufficiently large numbers of people are immune to the usual standards for truth. But because I can't predict which lies future generations will consider inexcusable, I can't safely omit any type we tell. Yes, it seems unlikely that religion will be out of fashion in 100 years, but no more unlikely than it would have seemed to someone in 1880 that schoolchildren in 1980 would be taught that masturbation was perfectly normal and not to feel guilty about it."}]}

If you freak out when people tell you alarming things, they won't tell you them. Teenagers don't tell their parents what happened that night they were supposed to be staying at a friend's house for the same reason parents don't tell 5-year-olds the truth about the Thanksgiving turkey: they'd freak if they knew."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Craigslist maintain a competitive advantage in generating revenue compared to other companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Craigslist maintains a competitive advantage in generating revenue by effectively positioning itself \"upwind\" of enormous revenues. This strategic advantage allows them to decide when and if to engage with competitors. While they may face challenges if they wanted to increase their revenue further, these challenges differ significantly from those encountered by companies that struggle to sell inferior products to indifferent users, often spending ten times as much on sales as on development."}]}

They didn't have ads for over a year. At year one, Google was indistinguishable from a nonprofit. If a nonprofit or government organization had started a project to index the web, Google at year one is the limit of what they'd have produced."}]}

I wasn't thinking of it as a company; I just wanted to keep people from getting spammed. But as I thought more about this project, I realized it would probably have to be a company. It would cost something to run, and it would be a pain to fund with grants and donations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What surprising insight did the author have about the relationship between benevolence and company structure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That was a surprising realization.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What opportunity was missed in the email service industry due to poor spam filtering during a specific time period?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There was a window of about two years when spam was increasing rapidly, but all the big email services had terrible filters. If someone had launched a new, spam-free mail service, users would have flocked to it. I didn't want to start another company, so I didn't do it. But if someone had, they'd probably be quite rich now."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do successful startups and nonprofits exhibit similar behaviors and ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Notice the pattern here?

Obviously, it worked for Google, but what about Microsoft? Surely Microsoft isn't benevolent? When I think back to the beginning, they were. Compared to IBM, they were like Robin Hood. When IBM introduced the PC, they thought they were going to make money selling hardware at high prices. However, by gaining control of the PC standard, Microsoft opened up the market to any manufacturer. Hardware prices plummeted, and lots of people got to have computers who couldn't otherwise have afforded them. It's the sort of thing you'd expect Google to do."}]}

When you're small, you can't bully customers, so you have to charm them. Whereas when you're big, you can maltreat them at will, and you tend to, because it's easier than satisfying them. You grow big by being nice, but you can stay big by being mean."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does benevolence contribute to the success of startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a lot of external evidence that benevolence works. But how does it work? One advantage of investing in a large number of startups is that you get a lot of data about how they work. From what we've seen, being good seems to help startups in three ways: it improves their morale, it makes other people want to help them, and above all, it helps them be decisive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does morale impact the success of a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Morale is tremendously important to a startupâso important that morale alone is almost enough to determine success. Startups are often described as emotional roller coasters. One minute you're going to take over the world, and the next you're doomed. The problem with feeling you're doomed is not just that it makes you unhappy, but that it makes you less productive and can negatively affect team dynamics."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do attitudes towards success and failure impact effort and outcomes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The downhills of the roller coaster are more of a self-fulfilling prophecy than the uphills. If you feel you're going to succeed, that makes you work harder, which probably improves your chances of succeeding. However, if you feel you're going to fail, that can make you stop working, which practically guarantees you'll fail."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does a sense of benevolence affect an entrepreneur's perseverance in the face of challenges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Benevolence plays a crucial role in an entrepreneur's perseverance. If you feel you're genuinely helping people, you'll continue working even when it seems like your startup is doomed. Most of us have some amount of natural benevolence; the mere fact that someone needs you makes you want to help them. So, if you start a type of startup where users come back each day, you've essentially built yourself a giant Tamagotchi. You've created something that you need to take care of."}]}

At one point, they ran out of money, and everyone left. Evan Williams came in to work the next day, and there was no one but him. What kept him going? Partly that users needed him. He was hosting thousands of people's blogs, and he couldn't just let the site die."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of acquiring users early in the product launch process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are many advantages to launching quickly, but the most important may be that once you have users, the Tamagotchi effect kicks in. Once you have users to take care of, you're forced to figure out what will make them happy, and that's actually very valuable information."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated the founders to commit to their service despite potential personal sacrifices?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "He told me recently that he and his cofounder had decided that this service was something the world needed, so they were going to keep working on it no matter what, even if they had to move back to Canada and live in their parents' basements."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does a strong sense of mission contribute to the resilience of a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A strong sense of mission contributes to the resilience of a startup by making the founders deeply committed to their goals. If you're really committed and your startup is cheap to run, you become very hard to kill. Practically all startups, even the most successful, come close to death at some point. So, if doing good for people gives you a sense of mission that makes you harder to kill, that alone more than compensates for whatever you lose by not choosing a more selfish project."}]}

Users like it, and they've been growing rapidly. And yet, for most of Octopart's life, the biggest distributor, Digi-Key, has been trying to force them to take their prices off the site. Octopart is sending them customers for free, and yet Digi-Key is trying to make that traffic stop. Why? Because their current business model depends on overcharging people who have incomplete information about prices. They don't want search to work."}]}

If you can attract the best hackers to work for you, as Google has, you have a big advantage. The very best hackers tend to be idealistic; they are not desperate for a job and can work wherever they want. Therefore, most want to work on things that will make the world better."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can a strong user base influence investor confidence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A strong user base can significantly influence investor confidence. If you make something that users love enough to tell their friends, you can grow exponentially. This growth can be a more reliable way to convince investors than simply trying to sell them on your idea. When investors see a product that has a passionate and expanding user base, it reassures them of the potential for success and profitability."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is being honest considered a beneficial approach in complex decision-making scenarios?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Being honest is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions in complex situations because it's stateless. It's like telling the truth. The trouble with lying is that you have to remember everything you've said in the past to make sure you don't contradict yourself. If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything, and that's a really useful property in domains where things happen fast."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach does Y Combinator take when advising multiple startups simultaneously?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Y Combinator takes a stateless algorithm approach when advising multiple startups simultaneously. With 80 startups invested in, 57 of which are still operational, it becomes essential to avoid ulterior motives. When managing 57 startups, it is impossible to remember all the details. Therefore, the guiding principle is to do whatever is best for the founders. This approach is not based on benevolence but is the only algorithm that works effectively at that scale."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the concept of being \"good\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you write something telling people to be good, you seem to be claiming to be good yourself. So I want to say explicitly that I am not a particularly good person. When I was a kid, I was firmly in the camp of bad. The way adults used the word good, it seemed to be synonymous with quiet, so I grew up very suspicious of it."}]}

Now, many tech companies don't. The markets seem to have figured out how to value potential dividends. Maybe that isn't the last step in this evolution. Perhaps markets will eventually get comfortable with potential earnings. (VCs already are, and at least some of them consistently make money.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes genuine growth from artificial growth in a company's success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Genuine growth is distinguished from artificial growth in a company's success by the sustainability and authenticity of that growth. For example, it's okay to focus on growth instead of profitsâbut only if the growth is genuine. You can't be buying users; that's a pyramid scheme. However, a company with rapid, genuine growth is valuable, and eventually, markets learn how to value valuable things."}]}

I once asked a physicist friend if Einstein was really as smart as his fame implies, and she said that yes, he was. So why isn't he on the list? Because I had to ask.

For example, it returned false for Montaigne, who was arguably the inventor of the essay. Why? When I thought about what it meant to call someone a hero, it meant I'd decide what to do by asking what they'd do in the same situation. That's a stricter standard than admiration."}]}

Everyone on the list had two qualities: they cared almost excessively about their work, and they were absolutely honest. By honest, I don't mean trustworthy so much as that they never pander; they never say or do something because that's what the audience wants. They are all fundamentally subversive for this reason, though they conceal it to varying degrees."}]}

Unless you were there, it's hard to imagine how that town felt about the Steelers. Locally, all the news was bad. The steel industry was dying. But the Steelers were the best team in football â and moreover, in a way that seemed to reflect the personality of the city. They didn't do anything fancy; they just got the job done."}]}

I had a few other teachers who were smart, but I wouldn't describe them as intellectually curious. In retrospect, he was out of place as an elementary school teacher, and I think he knew it.

Kids are good at telling that. The other teachers were, at best, benevolently indifferent. But Mr. Mihalko seemed like he actually wanted to be our friend. On the last day of fourth grade, he got out one of the heavy school record players and played James Taylor's \"You've Got a Friend\" for us. \"Just call out my name, and you know wherever I am, I'll come running.\" He died at 59 of lung cancer.

You see paintings and drawings in museums and imagine they were made for you to look at. Actually, a lot of the best ones were made as a way of exploring the world, not as a way to please other people. The best of these explorations are sometimes more pleasing than stuff made explicitly to please."}]}

If you want to be thought a great novelist in your own time, you have to sound intellectual. If what you write is popular, or entertaining, or funny, you're ipso facto suspect. That makes Wodehouse doubly impressive because it meant that to write as he wanted to, he had to commit to being despised in his own lifetime."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How was Evelyn Waugh's assessment of a certain writer perceived by the literary community of his time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Evelyn Waugh called him a great writer, but to most people at the time, that would have read as a chivalrous or deliberately perverse gesture. At the time, any random autobiographical novel by a recent college grad could count on more respectful treatment from the literary establishment."}]}

But Wodehouse didn't give a damn what anyone thought of him. He wrote exactly what he wanted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities of Modernism distinguished it from the art of the nineteenth century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What was good about Modernism was its freshness. Art became stuffy in the nineteenth century. The paintings that were popular at the time were mostly the art equivalent of McMansionsâbig, pretentious, and fake. Modernism meant starting over, making things with the same earnest motives that children might. The artists who benefited most from this were the ones who had preserved a child's confidence, like Klee and Calder."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities make Calder's art more appealing to some viewers compared to Klee's?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Klee was impressive because he could work in so many different styles. However, between the two, I like Calder better because his work seemed happier. Ultimately, the point of art is to engage the viewer. It's hard to predict what will engage; often, something that seems interesting at first will bore you after a month. Calder's art has a joyful quality that resonates with me more than Klee's."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities of Calder's work contribute to its enduring appeal and sense of happiness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Calder's work never gets boring. They just sit there quietly radiating optimism, like a battery that never runs out. As far as I can tell from books and photographs, the happiness of Calder's work is his own happiness showing through."}]}

When I read most novels, I pay as much attention to the author's choices as to the story. But in her novels, I can't see the gears at work. Though I'd really like to know how she does what she does, I can't figure it out because she's so good that her stories don't seem made up. I feel like I'm reading a description of something that actually happened."}]}

Paradoxically, one of the reasons his achievement is hard to appreciate is that it was so successful. Practically every programming language invented in the last 20 years includes ideas from Lisp, and each year the median language gets more Lisplike."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did John McCarthy contribute to the evolution of programming languages in 1958?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In 1958, these ideas were anything but obvious. There seemed to be two ways of thinking about programming. Some people thought of it as math and proved things about Turing Machines. Others thought of it as a way to get things done and designed languages all too influenced by the technology of the day. McCarthy alone bridged the gap. He designed a language that was math. But \"designed\" is not really the word; \"discovered\" is more like it."}]}

The Spitfire's original nemesis, the ME 109, was a brutally practical plane. It was a killing machine. The Spitfire was optimism embodied.

I remember exactly where I was when a friend asked if I'd heard Steve Jobs had cancer. It was like the floor dropped out. A few seconds later, she told me that it was a rare operable type and that he'd be okay. But those seconds seemed long."}]}

He doesnât design Appleâs products himself. Historically, the closest analogy to what he does are the great Renaissance patrons of the arts. As the CEO of a company, that makes him unique."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Steve Jobs influence people's perception of taste in design?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Steve Jobs has influenced people's perception of taste in design by demonstrating that he possesses exceptional taste himself.

He worked on big things, at least for part of his life. It's so easy to get distracted working on small stuff. The questions you're answering are pleasantly familiar.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is disagreement often more stimulating in discussions than agreement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many who respond to something disagree with it. That's to be expected. Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing. When you agree, there's less to say. You could expand on something the author said, but he has probably already explored the most interesting implications. When you disagree, you're entering territory he may not have explored."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors are contributing to the increase in disagreement in online communication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The result is that there's a lot more disagreeing going on, especially measured by the word. That doesn't mean people are getting angrier. The structural change in the way we communicate is enough to account for it. But though it's not anger that's driving the increase in disagreement, there's a danger that the increase in disagreement will make people angrier, particularly online, where it's easy to say things you'd never say face to face."}]}

It's still a very weak form of disagreement, though. If there's something wrong with the senator's argument, you should say what it is; and if there isn't, what difference does it make that he's a senator?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it problematic to dismiss an author's ideas based solely on their perceived lack of authority?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dismissing an author's ideas based solely on their perceived lack of authority is a variant of ad hominemâand a particularly useless sortâbecause good ideas often come from outsiders. The question is whether the author is correct or not. If his lack of authority caused him to make mistakes, point those out. And if it didn't, it's not a problem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it more important to focus on the validity of an author's argument rather than their tone?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Though better than attacking the author, this is still a weak form of disagreement. It matters much more whether the author is wrong or right than what his tone is, especially since tone is so hard to judge. Someone who has a chip on their shoulder about some topic might be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should be the focus of criticism when evaluating an author's work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When evaluating an author's work, the focus of criticism should be on the accuracy of the content rather than merely the tone. If the worst thing you can say about a piece is to criticize its tone, you're not saying much. Is the author flippant but correct? Better that than grave and wrong. If the author is incorrect somewhere, it is important to specify where those inaccuracies lie."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characterizes the lowest form of response to an argument?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The lowest form of response to an argument is simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supporting evidence. In this stage, we finally get responses to what was said, rather than how or by whom."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the nature of counterarguments and why do they often lead to misunderstandings in discussions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Counterarguments are contradictions accompanied by reasoning and/or evidence. When aimed squarely at the original argument, they can be convincing. Unfortunately, it is common for counterarguments to be directed at something slightly different. More often than not, two people arguing passionately about a topic are actually debating two different things. Sometimes they even agree with one another, but are so caught up in their squabble that they don't realize it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to clarify when you are presenting a different argument from the original author's?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is important to clarify when you are presenting a different argument from the original author's because there could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something slightly different from what the original author said: when you feel they missed the heart of the matter. However, when you do that, you should say explicitly that you are doing it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the most convincing and rare form of disagreement, and how does it relate to the hierarchy of disagreement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation. It's also the rarest because it's the most work. Indeed, the disagreement hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher you go, the fewer instances you find."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the process for effectively refuting someone's argument?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To refute someone's argument, you probably have to quote them. You need to find a \"smoking gun,\" a passage in whatever you disagree with that you feel is mistaken, and then explain why it's mistaken. If you can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing with a straw man."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between quoting and refutation in writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn't necessarily imply refutation. Some writers quote parts of things they disagree with to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, then follow with a response as low as DH3 or even DH0."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some tactics individuals use to undermine opposing arguments without addressing the main points?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even as high as DH5, we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty, as when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutes those. Sometimes the spirit in which this is done makes it more of a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation. For example, correcting someone's grammar or harping on minor mistakes in names or numbers. Unless the opposing argument actually depends on such things, the only purpose of correcting them is to discredit one's opponent."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is necessary for a refutation to be considered truly effective?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point, or at least one of them. That means one has to commit explicitly to what the central point is. So a truly effective refutation would look like:"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do DH levels indicate about the correctness of a statement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DH levels merely describe the form of a statement, not whether it's correct. A DH6 response could still be completely mistaken."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between DH levels and the convincingness of a response?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But while DH levels don't set a lower bound on the convincingness of a reply, they do set an upper bound. A DH6 response might be unconvincing, but a DH2 or lower response is always unconvincing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can classifying forms of disagreement enhance critical reading skills?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement is that it helps people evaluate what they read. In particular, it helps them see through intellectually dishonest arguments. An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishing an opponent merely by using forceful words. In fact, that is probably the defining quality of a demagogue. By giving names to the different forms of disagreement, we provide critical readers with a pin for popping such balloons."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can recognizing one's position in a disagreement hierarchy improve the quality of a writer's argument?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Recognizing one's position in a disagreement hierarchy can significantly improve the quality of a writer's argument. Such labels may help writers too. Most intellectual dishonesty is unintentional. Someone arguing against the tone of something he disagrees with may believe he's really saying something. Zooming out and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy may inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the psychological benefits of engaging in constructive disagreements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it will make conversations better, but that it will make the people who have them happier. If you study conversations, you find there is a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6. You don't have to be mean when you have a real point to make. In fact, you don't want to. If you have something real to say, being mean just gets in the way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does moving up the disagreement hierarchy affect people's behavior and happiness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean, that will make most of them happier. Most people don't really enjoy being mean; they do it because they can't help it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What inspired the author to write this essay about Y Combinator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This essay grew out of something I wrote for myself to figure out what we do.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the challenges animals face in thermoregulation as they change in size?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you scale animals, you can't just keep everything in proportion. For example, volume grows as the cube of linear dimension, but surface area only grows as the square. So, as animals get bigger, they have trouble radiating heat. That's why mice and rabbits are furry, while elephants and hippos aren't. You can't make a mouse by scaling down an elephant."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do venture capital funds differ from other sources of startup funding in terms of the stage of companies they typically support?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Venture capital funds typically support later-stage companies compared to other sources of startup funding. While VCs provide substantial financial resources, which can be very valuable, they are often viewed primarily as sources of money. Good VCs are considered \"smart money,\" but they still fundamentally represent a financial investment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the role of investor support change between early-stage and late-stage funding rounds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All good investors supply a combination of money and help. But these scale differently, just as volume and surface area do. Late-stage investors supply huge amounts of money and comparatively little help: when a company about to go public gets a mezzanine round of $50 million, the deal tends to be almost entirely about money. As you move earlier in the venture funding process, the ratio of help to money increases because earlier-stage companies have different needs. Early-stage companies need less money because they're smaller and cheaper to run, but they need more help because life is so precarious for them. So when VCs do a Series A round for, say, $2 million, they generally expect to offer a significant amount of help along with the money."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does Y Combinator play in the startup funding process compared to venture capital funding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Y Combinator occupies the earliest end of the spectrum. We're at least one and generally two steps before VC funding. Though some startups go straight from YC to VC, the most common trajectory is to do an angel round first. What happens at Y Combinator is as different from what happens in a Series A round as a Series A round is from a mezzanine financing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the primary challenges faced by early-stage startups beyond financial considerations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At our end, money is almost a negligible factor. The startup usually consists of just the founders. Their living expenses are the company's main expense, and since most founders are under 30, their living expenses are low. But at this early stage, companies need a lot of help. Practically every question is still unanswered. Some companies we've funded have been working on their software for a year or more, but others haven't decided what to work on, or even who the founders should be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common misconception do PR people and journalists have about the early stages of successful startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When PR people and journalists recount the histories of startups after they've become big, they always underestimate how uncertain things were at first. They're not being deliberately misleading. When you look at a company like Google, it's hard to imagine they could once have been small and helpless. Sure, at one point they were just a couple of guys in a garageâbut even then, their greatness was assured, and all they had to do was roll forward along the railroad tracks of destiny."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do founders of early-stage startups often become very wealthy despite the high risks involved?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We know, because we've been there, just how vulnerable startups are in the earliest phases. Curiously enough, that's why founders tend to get so rich from them. Reward is always proportionate to risk, and very early-stage startups are insanely risky."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary function of Y Combinator in relation to startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What we really do at Y Combinator is get startups launched straight. One of the many metaphors you could use for YC is a steam catapult on an aircraft carrier. We get startups airborneâbarely airborne, but enough that they can accelerate fast."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes the launch of a company from the launch of a product in the context of startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Launching companies isn't identical to launching products. Though we do spend a lot of time on launch strategies for products, there are some things that take too long to build for a startup to launch them before raising their next round of funding. Several of the most promising startups we've funded haven't launched their products yet, but are definitely launched as companies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the primary focus areas for early-stage startups compared to later-stage startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the earliest stage, startups not only have more questions to answer, but they tend to be different kinds of questions. In later-stage startups, the questions are about deals, hiring, or organization. In the earliest phase, they tend to be about technology and design. What do you make? That's the first problem to solve. That's why our motto is \"Make something people want.\" This is always a good thing for companies to do, but it's even more important early on because it sets the bounds for every other question. Who you hire, how much money you raise, and how you market yourselfâthey all depend on what you're making."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What skills are essential for venture capitalists to be effective during the phase between series A and IPO?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because the early problems are so much about technology and design, you probably need to be hackers to do what we do. While some VCs have technical backgrounds, I don't know any who still write code. Their expertise is mostly in businessâas it should be, because that's the kind of expertise you need in the phase between series A and (if you're lucky) IPO."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors have contributed to the decrease in costs for starting web-based startups compared to biotech startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other reason no one was doing quite what we do is that, until recently, it was a lot more expensive to start a startup. You'll notice we haven't funded any biotech startups; that's still expensive. However, advancing technology has made web startups so cheap that you really can get a company airborne for $15,000, if you understand how to operate a steam catapult, at least."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Y Combinator differentiate itself from traditional venture capital funds in the startup ecosystem?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In effect, what's happened is that a new ecological niche has opened up, and Y Combinator is the new kind of animal that has moved into it. We're not a replacement for venture capital funds; we occupy a new, adjacent niche. The conditions in our niche are really quite different. It's not just that the problems we face are different; the whole structure of the business is different. VCs are playing a zero-sum game. They're all competing for a slice of a fixed amount of \"deal flow,\" and that explains a lot of their behavior. Whereas our M.O. is to create new deal flow by encouraging hackers who would have gotten jobs to start their own startups instead. We compete more with employers than VCs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the author's feelings about the negativity within hacker culture?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Something about hacker culture that never really sat well with me was this â the nastiness. I just don't understand why people troll like they do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the original meaning of the term \"troll\" in online forums?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two senses of the word \"troll.\" In the original sense, it meant someone, usually an outsider, who deliberately stirred up fights in a forum by saying controversial things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an example of trolling behavior in online forums?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, someone who didn't use a certain programming language might go to a forum for users of that language and make disparaging remarks about it, then sit back and watch as people rose to the bait. This sort of trolling is in the nature of a practical joke, like letting a bat loose in a room full of people."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some psychological factors that contribute to trolling behavior online?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Trolling, in the broader sense, has four causes. The most important is distance. People will say things in anonymous forums that they'd never dare say to someone's face, just as they'll do things in cars that they'd never do as pedestriansâlike tailgate people, honk at them, or cut them off."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is trolling more prevalent in computer-related forums?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Trolling tends to be particularly bad in forums related to computers, and I think that's due to the kind of people you find there. Most of them (myself included) are more comfortable dealing with abstract ideas than with people. Hackers can be abrupt even in person. Put them on an anonymous forum, and the problem gets worse."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological factors contribute to the behavior of trolling in online interactions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The third cause of trolling is incompetence. If you disagree with something, it's easier to say \"you suck\" than to figure out and explain exactly what you disagree with. You're also safe that way from refutation. In this respect, trolling is a lot like graffiti. Graffiti happens at the intersection of ambition and incompetence: people want to make their mark on the world but have no other way to do it than literally making a mark on the world."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the presence of trolls impact the community dynamics of online forums?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a sort of Gresham's Law of trolls: trolls are willing to use a forum with a lot of thoughtful people in it, but thoughtful people aren't willing to use a forum with a lot of trolls in it. This means that once trolling takes hold, it tends to become the dominant culture. That had already happened to Slashdot and Digg by the time I paid attention to comment threads there, but I watched it happen to Reddit."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What measures are in place to maintain respectful communication in online interactions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We explicitly ask people not to say things they wouldn't say face to face. If someone starts being rude, other users will step in and tell them to stop. When people seem to be deliberately trolling, we ban them ruthlessly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do different platforms handle user feedback and its impact on reputation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Technical tweaks may also help. On Reddit, votes on your comments don't affect your karma score, but they do on News.YC. It does seem to influence people when they can see their reputation in the eyes of their peers drain away after making an inappropriate remark. Often, users have second thoughts and delete such comments."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What types of comments are most likely to be deleted by users in online discussions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One might worry this would prevent people from expressing controversial ideas, but empirically that doesn't seem to be what happens. When people say something substantial that gets modded down, they stubbornly leave it up. What people delete are wisecracks because they have less invested in them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges does the experiment face in maintaining the quality of conversations as it grows in user base?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So far, the experiment seems to be working. The level of conversation on News.YC is as high as on any forum I've seen. However, we still only have about 8,000 unique visitors a day. The conversations on Reddit were good when it was that small. The challenge is whether we can keep things this way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the distinction between impressive graffiti and everyday tagging?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am talking here about everyday tagging.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the author come to regarding their design philosophy after receiving criticism about their work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I had an unexpected consequence: it made me realize I had a design philosophy. The main complaint of the more articulate critics was that Arc seemed so flimsy. After years of working on it, all I had to show for myself were a few thousand lines of macros.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the initial perceptions of users about Viaweb's e-commerce capabilities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Users initially perceived Viaweb's e-commerce capabilities as limited; the app they had seen seemed to be nothing more than a website. They were even more contemptuous when they discovered that Viaweb didn't process credit card transactions (we didn't for the whole first year).

Traditional startup funding typically involves series A rounds, where millions of dollars are given to a small number of startups founded by individuals with established credentials, following months of serious, businesslike meetings and on terms described in a document a foot thick. In contrast, Y Combinator's model appears more lightweight and accessible, focusing on early-stage funding for a larger number of startups. While it's too early to say whether Y Combinator will achieve the same success as Viaweb, the growing number of imitations suggests that many people believe they are onto something."}]}

At first, the default reaction of the Slashdot trolls was (translated into articulate terms): \"Who is this guy and what authority does he have to write about these topics? I haven't read the essay, but there's no way anything so short and written in such an informal style could have anything useful to say about such and such topic, when people with degrees in the subject have already written many thick books about it.\" Now there's a new generation of trolls on a new generation of sites, but they have at least started to omit the initial \"Who is this guy?\""}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges might arise when presenting simple solutions to complex problems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I first laid out these principles explicitly, I noticed something striking: this is practically a recipe for generating a contemptuous initial reaction. Though simple solutions are better, they don't seem as impressive as complex ones. Overlooked problems are, by definition, problems that most people think don't matter. Delivering solutions in an informal way means that instead of judging something by the way it's presented, people have to actually understand it, which is more work. And starting with a crude version 1 means your initial effort is always small and incomplete."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of using contrarian investment strategies and addressing overlooked problems in order to foster innovation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Contrarian investment strategies are beneficial because they provide advantages that others forgo in their pursuit of legitimacy. By focusing on overlooked problems, you are more likely to discover new opportunities due to reduced competition. Delivering solutions informally allows you to (a) save the effort required to make them appear impressive, and (b) avoid the risk of deceiving both yourself and your audience. Additionally, by releasing a crude version 1 and iterating, your solution can benefit from the creativity of nature, which, as Feynman pointed out, is more powerful than your own."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the key challenges and solutions faced by Viaweb in developing its software for online stores?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the case of Viaweb, the simple solution was to make the software run on the server. The overlooked problem was to generate websites automatically; in 1995, online stores were all made by hand by human designers, but we knew this wouldn't scale. The part that actually mattered was graphic design, not transaction processing. The informal delivery mechanism was me, showing up in jeans and a t-shirt at some retailer's office. And the crude version 1 was, if I remember correctly, less than 10,000 lines of code when we launched."}]}

There are always new ideas right under your nose. So look for simple things that other people have overlookedâthings people will later claim were \"obvious\"âespecially when they've been led astray by obsolete conventions or by trying to do things that are superficially impressive. Figure out what the real problem is, and make sure you solve that. Don't worry about trying to look corporate; the product is what wins in the long term. And launch as soon as you can, so you start learning from users what you should have been making."}]}

Every other funding cycle is in Boston. Even though Boston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world), we advise the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to move to Silicon Valley. If that's true of Boston, it's even more true of every other city."}]}

Dealing with immigration problems is like raising money; for some reason, it seems to consume all your attention. A startup can't afford much of that. One Canadian startup we funded spent about six months working on moving to the U.S. Eventually, they just gave up because they couldn't afford to take so much time away from working on their software."}]}

Silicon Valley investors are noticeably more aggressive than Boston ones. Over and over, I've seen startups we've funded snatched by West Coast investors out from under the noses of Boston investors who saw them first but acted too slowly. At this year's Boston Demo Day, I told the audience that this happened every year, so if they saw a startup they liked, they should make them an offer. And yet, within a month, it had happened again: an aggressive West Coast VC who had met the founder of a YC-funded startup a week before beat out a Boston VC who had known him for years. By the time the Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was already gone."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are Boston investors considered more conservative compared to their counterparts in Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Boston investors will admit they're more conservative. Some want to believe this comes from the city's prudent Yankee character. But Occam's razor suggests the truth is less flattering. Boston investors are probably more conservative than Silicon Valley investors for the same reason Chicago investors are more conservative than Boston ones: they don't understand startups as well."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do West coast investors tend to take bolder risks in venture investing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "West coast investors aren't bolder because they're irresponsible cowboys or because the good weather makes them optimistic. They're bolder because they know what they're doing. They're the skiers who ski on the diamond slopes. Boldness is the essence of venture investing. The way you get big returns is not by trying to avoid losses but by trying to ensure you get some of the big hits. And the big hits often look risky at first."}]}

If the aggressive ways of West Coast investors are going to come back to bite them, it has been a long time coming. Silicon Valley has been pulling ahead of Boston since the 1970s.

In fact, this is part of the reason Y Combinator is in Boston half the time: it's hard to stand that year-round.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do startups tend to succeed in environments like Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups tend to thrive in startup hubs like Silicon Valley because these environments are highly specialized, much like diamond cutting.

I had several motives, some more honorable than others. One of the less honorable was to shock people. College was regarded as job training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively impractical thing to do.

It was presumably many thousands of years between when people first started describing things as hot or cold and when someone asked, \"What is heat?\" No doubt it was a very gradual process. We don't know if Plato or Aristotle were the first to ask any of the questions they did. But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a large scale, and there is a freshness (not to say naivete) about them that suggests some of the questions they asked were new to them, at least."}]}

It was impressive even to ask the questions they did. That doesn't mean they always came up with good answers. It's not considered insulting to say that ancient Greek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked some concepts that would have made their lives easier. So I hope people will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosophers were similarly naive. In particular, they don't seem to have fully grasped what I earlier called the central fact of philosophy: that words break if you push them too far."}]}

Certainly, people who want a deep understanding of something are often driven by curiosity rather than any practical need. But that doesn't mean what they end up learning is useless. It's very valuable in practice to have a deep understanding of what you're doing; even if you're never called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcuts in the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down in edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you didn't understand. Knowledge is power. That's what makes theoretical knowledge prestigious.

Traditional philosophy occupies a kind of singularity in this respect. If you write in an unclear way about big ideas, you produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive to inexperienced but intellectually ambitious students. Until one knows better, it's hard to distinguish something that's hard to understand because the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like a mathematical proof that's hard to understand because the ideas it represents are hard to understand.

What was I? A student. To do that well meant to get good grades. Why did one have to get good grades? To get into a good college. And why did one want to do that? There seemed to be several reasons: you'd learn more, get better jobs, and make more money. But it didn't matter exactly what the benefits would be. College was a bottleneck through which all your future prospects passed; everything would be better if you went to a better college."}]}

The idea doesn't matter much; it will change anyway. Most of our decision is based on the founders. The average founder is three years out of college. Many have just graduated; a few are still in school. So we're in much the same position as a graduate program or a company hiring people right out of college. Except our choices are immediately and visibly tested. There are two possible outcomes for a startup: success or failureâand usually, you know within a year which it will be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors primarily determine the success or failure of a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The test applied to a startup is among the purest of real-world tests. A startup succeeds or fails depending almost entirely on the efforts of the founders. Success is decided by the market: you only succeed if users like what you've built. And users don't care where you went to college."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the investment strategy of the venture capital fund described in the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As well as having precisely measurable results, we have a lot of them. Instead of doing a small number of large deals like a traditional venture capital fund, we do a large number of small ones. We currently fund about 40 companies a year, selected from about 900 applications representing a total of about 2,000 people."}]}

One of the most surprising things we've learned is how little it matters where people went to college."}]}

We're talking about a decision made by admissions officersâbasically, HR peopleâbased on a cursory examination of a huge pile of depressingly similar applications submitted by seventeen-year-olds. And what do they have to go on? An easily gamed standardized test; a short essay telling you what the kid thinks you want to hear; an interview with a random alum; a high school record that's largely an index of obedience. Who would rely on such a test?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence decision-making when purchasing enterprise software for large organizations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There used to be a saying in the corporate world: \"No one ever got fired for buying IBM.\" You no longer hear this about IBM specifically, but the idea is very much alive; there is a whole category of \"enterprise\" software companies that exist to take advantage of it. People buying technology for large organizations don't care if they pay a fortune for mediocre software. It's not their money. They just want to buy from a supplier who seems safeâa company with an established name, confident salesmen, impressive offices, and software that conforms to all the current fashions. Not necessarily a company that will deliver, so much as one that, if they do let you down, will still seem to have been a prudent choice. So companies have evolved to fill that niche."}]}

But they work as if they had. In addition to the power of the brand name, graduates of elite colleges have two critical qualities that plug right into the way large organizations work. They're good at doing what they're asked, since that's what it takes to please the adults who judge you at seventeen. And having been to an elite college makes them more confident."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities were valued in employees during the era of long-term careers at a single company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "During the era when people might spend their whole careers at one big company, certain qualities were highly valued in employees. Graduates of elite colleges were often capable yet amenable to authority. Since individual performance is difficult to measure in large organizations, their own confidence served as the starting point for their reputation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors do users prioritize when evaluating a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the new world of startups, things are very different. We couldn't save someone from the market's judgment even if we wanted to. Being charming and confident counts for nothing with users. All users care about is whether you make something they like. If you don't, you're dead."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors are more indicative of an individual's potential for success than their educational background?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Knowing that a test is coming makes us work a lot harder to get the right answers than anyone would if they were merely hiring people. We can't afford to have any illusions about the predictors of success. What we've found is that the variation between schools is so much smaller than the variation between individuals that it's negligible by comparison. We can learn more about someone in the first minute of talking to them than by knowing where they went to school."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence the amount of knowledge a student gains during their college experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The amount of knowledge a student gains during their college experience depends a lot more on the student than on the college itself. A determined party animal can get through the best school without learning anything. Conversely, someone with a real thirst for knowledge will be able to find a few smart people to learn from at a school that isn't prestigious at all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary benefit of attending an elite college, and how can students replicate this experience at other institutions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other students are the biggest advantage of going to an elite college; you learn more from them than from the professors. But you should be able to reproduce this at most colleges if you make a conscious effort to find smart friends. At most colleges, you can find at least a handful of other smart students, and most people have only a handful of close friends in college anyway."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What can be said about the distribution of intelligence among professors compared to students in math and hard sciences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The odds of finding smart professors are even better. The curve for faculty is a lot flatter than for students, especially in math and the hard sciences; you have to go pretty far down the list of colleges before you stop finding smart professors in the math department."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How significant is the prestige of a college in evaluating an individual's abilities and potential?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is not surprising that we have found the relative prestige of different colleges to be useless in judging individuals. There is a lot of randomness in how colleges select people, and what they learn there depends much more on them than on the college. Between these two sources of variation, the college someone attended doesn't mean a lot. It is to some degree a predictor of ability, but so weak that we regard it mainly as a source of error and try consciously to ignore it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the author suggest about the perception of college importance over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I doubt what we've discovered is an anomaly specific to startups. Probably, people have always overestimated the importance of where one goes to college. We're just finally able to measure it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do societal perceptions of college attendance affect individual self-esteem and feelings of belonging?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The unfortunate thing is not just that people are judged by such a superficial test, but that so many judge themselves by it. A lot of people, probably the majority of people in America, have some amount of insecurity about where, or whether, they went to college. The tragedy of the situation is that by far the greatest liability of not having gone to the college you'd have liked is your own feeling that you're thereby lacking something. Colleges are a bit like exclusive clubs in this respect. There is only one real advantage to being a member of most exclusive clubs: you know you wouldn't be missing much if you weren't. When you're excluded, you can only imagine the advantages of being an insider. But invariably, they're larger in your imagination than in real life."}]}

People aren't what some admissions officer decides about them at seventeen; they're what they make themselves."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of focusing on personal development rather than college admissions for students?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, the great advantage of not caring where people went to college is not just that you can stop judging them (and yourself) by superficial measures, but that you can focus instead on what really matters. What matters is what you make of yourself. I think that's what we should tell kids. Their job isn't to get good grades so they can get into a good college, but to learn and do. And not just because that's more rewarding than worldly success. That will increasingly matter."}]}

Mitch Kapor's wife, Freada, was in charge of HR at Lotus in the early years. (As he is at pains to point out, they did not become romantically involved till afterward.) At one point, they worried Lotus was losing its startup edge and turning into a big company. So, as an experiment, she sent their recruiters the resumes of the first 40 employees, with identifying details changed. These were the people who had made Lotus into the star it was. Not one got an interview."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do skilled programmers conceptualize and engage with their code similarly to mathematicians with mathematical problems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A good programmer working intensively on his own code can hold it in his mind the way a mathematician holds a problem he's working on. Mathematicians don't answer questions by working them out on paper the way schoolchildren are taught to. They do more in their heads: they try to understand a problem space well enough that they can walk around it the way you can walk around the memory of the house you grew up in. At its best, programming is the same. You hold the whole program in your head, and you can manipulate it at will."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is flexibility important at the beginning of a project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's particularly valuable at the start of a project because initially, the most important thing is to be able to change what you're doing. Not just to solve the problem in a different way, but to change the problem you're solving."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does writing code contribute to your understanding of a problem?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your code is your understanding of the problem you're exploring. So it's only when you have your code in your head that you really understand the problem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do programmers face in maintaining an understanding of their projects over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not easy to get a program into your head. If you leave a project for a few months, it can take days to really understand it again when you return to it. Even when you're actively working on a program, it can take half an hour to load into your head when you start work each day. And that's in the best case. Ordinary programmers working in typical office conditions never enter this mode. Or to put it more dramatically, ordinary programmers working in typical office conditions never really understand the problems they're solving."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are distractions particularly detrimental to programming work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Distractions are detrimental to many types of work, but especially to programming, because programmers tend to operate at the limit of the detail they can handle."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might scheduled distractions be more detrimental to productivity than unscheduled ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oddly enough, scheduled distractions may be worse than unscheduled ones. If you know you have a meeting in an hour, you don't even start working on something hard."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of working in longer programming sessions compared to shorter ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since there's a fixed cost each time you start working on a program, it's more efficient to work in a few long sessions than many short ones. There will, of course, come a point where you get tired and less effective. This varies from person to person. I've heard of people hacking for 36 hours straight, but the most I've ever been able to manage is about 18, and I work best in chunks of no more than 12."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What benefits might arise from taking breaks during a challenging project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The optimum is not the limit you can physically endure. There's an advantage as well as a cost to breaking up a project. Sometimes, when you return to a problem after a rest, you find your unconscious mind has left an answer waiting for you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do programming languages influence the length and cognitive load of programs for developers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Programming languages make programs shorter. Programmers seem to think of programs at least partially in the language they're using to write them. The more succinct the language, the shorter the program, and the easier it is to load and keep in your head."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is bottom-up programming and how does it enhance the effectiveness of a programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can magnify the effect of a powerful language by using a style called bottom-up programming, where you write programs in multiple layers, the lower ones acting as programming languages for those above. If you do this right, you only have to keep the topmost layer in your head."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of rewriting a program beyond just achieving a cleaner design?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rewriting a program often yields a cleaner design. However, it has advantages even if it didn't: you must understand a program completely to rewrite it, so there is no better way to get it loaded into your head."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the considerations a programmer should keep in mind when writing code for themselves versus for others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All programmers know it's good to write readable code. But you yourself are the most important reader. Especially in the beginning, a prototype is a conversation with yourself. When writing for yourself, you have different priorities. If you're writing for other people, you may not want to make the code too dense. Some parts of a program may be easiest to read if you spread things out, like an introductory textbook. Whereas if you're writing code to make it easy to reload into your head, it may be best to go for brevity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the number of programmers on a project influence its capacity for redesign and mutation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you manipulate a program in your head, your vision tends to stop at the edge of the code you own. Other parts you don't understand as well, and more importantly, can't take liberties with. So, the smaller the number of programmers, the more completely a project can mutate. If there's just one programmer, as there often is at first, you can do all-encompassing redesigns."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might a single author have a better understanding of their code compared to a team of authors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You never understand other people's code as well as your own. No matter how thoroughly you've read it, you've only read it, not written it. So, if a piece of code is written by multiple authors, none of them understands it as well as a single author would."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the recommended approach for tackling a large and complex programming project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A program gets easier to hold in your head as you become familiar with it. You can start to treat parts as black boxes once you feel confident you've fully explored them. But when you first start working on a project, you're forced to see everything. If you start with too big a problem, you may never quite be able to encompass it. So if you need to write a big, complex program, the best way to begin may not be to write a spec for it, but to write a prototype that solves a subset of the problem. Whatever the advantages of planning, they're often outweighed by the advantages of being able to keep a program in your head."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a potential new model of organization that allows for individual contributions without requiring interchangeability?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe we could define a new kind of organization that combines the efforts of individuals without requiring them to be interchangeable. Arguably, a market is such a form of organization, though it may be more accurate to describe a market as a degenerate caseâas what you get by default when organization isn't possible."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What inherent conflict exists between software development and organizational structures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is a contradiction in the very phrase \"software company.\" The two words are pulling in opposite directions. Any good programmer in a large organization is going to be at odds with it because organizations are designed to prevent what programmers strive for. But regardless of what the solution turns out to be, the first step is to realize there's a problem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence the work habits and behaviors of programmers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The way programmers behave is driven by the demands of the work they do. It's not because they're irresponsible that they work in long binges during which they blow off all other obligations, plunge straight into programming instead of writing specs first, and rewrite code that already works. It's not because they're unfriendly that they prefer to work alone or growl at people who pop their head in the door to say hello. This apparently random collection of annoying habits has a single explanation: the power of holding a program in one's head."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantage do startups have over large organizations in terms of problem-solving?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups have a significant advantage over large organizations in terms of problem-solving because they allow individual programmers to do great work. The weakest point in big companies is that they often stifle creativity and innovation by not empowering their employees. Therefore, startups can effectively target and tackle the kinds of problems that require agile thinking and a unified vision, which can lead to more innovative solutions."}]}

Stuff used to be rare and valuable. You can still see evidence of that if you look for it. For example, in my house in Cambridge, which was built in 1876, the bedrooms don't have closets. In those days, people's stuff fit in a chest of drawers. Even as recently as a few decades ago, there was a lot less stuff. When I look back at photos from the 1970s, I'm surprised how empty houses look. As a kid, I had what I thought was a huge fleet of toy cars, but they'd be dwarfed by the number of toys my nephews have. All together, my Matchboxes and Corgis took up about a third of the surface of my bed. In my nephews' rooms, the bed is the only clear space."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did the author face regarding material possessions during a time of financial hardship?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That was a big problem for me when I had no money. I felt poor, and stuff seemed valuable, so almost instinctively I accumulated it. Friends would leave something behind when they moved, or I'd see something as I was walking down the street on trash night (beware of anything you find yourself describing as \"perfectly good\"), or I'd find something in almost new condition for a tenth of its retail price at a garage sale. And pow, more stuff."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is accumulating free or nearly free items often not a good idea?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, these free or nearly free items weren't bargains because they were worth even less than they cost.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the true measure of value when acquiring new items?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What I didn't understand was that the value of some new acquisition wasn't the difference between its retail price and what I paid for it. It was the value I derived from it. Stuff is an extremely illiquid asset. Unless you have some plan for selling that valuable thing you got so cheaply, what difference does it make what it's \"worth?\" The only way you're ever going to extract any value from it is to use it. And if you don't have any immediate use for it, you probably never will."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can excessive accumulation of possessions affect a person's lifestyle and choices?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, it's worse than worthless because once you've accumulated a certain amount of stuff, it starts to own you rather than the other way around. I know of one couple who couldn't retire to the town they preferred because they couldn't afford a place there big enough for all their stuff. Their house isn't theirs; it's their stuff's."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does a cluttered environment affect mental well-being and energy levels?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A cluttered environment can significantly affect mental well-being and energy levels. Unless you're extremely organized, a house full of stuff can be very depressing. A cluttered room saps one's spirits. One reason, obviously, is that there's less room for people in a room full of stuff. But there's more going on than that. Humans constantly scan their environment to build a mental model of what's around them. The harder a scene is to parse, the less energy you have left for conscious thoughts. A cluttered room is literally exhausting."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might children be less affected by clutter compared to adults?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This could explain why clutter doesn't seem to bother kids as much as adults. Kids are less perceptive; they build a coarser model of their surroundings, and this consumes less energy."}]}

I think that would work for any kind of purchase. Before you buy anything, ask yourself: Will this be something I use constantly? Or is it just something nice? Or worse still, a mere bargain?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the challenges associated with owning fragile items like \"good china\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The worst aspect of owning fragile items, like \"good china,\" may be that they are seldom used because they are considered too valuable. Nothing owns you like fragile items. For example, the \"good china\" that many households possess is often not fun to use, but rather requires extra caution to avoid breaking it."}]}

Obviously, it has to double: if you trade half your company for something that more than doubles the company's average outcome, you're net ahead. You have half as big a share of something worth more than twice as much."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why does Sequoia's investment strategy benefit startup founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason Sequoia's investment strategy benefits startup founders is that the percentage of the company they take is artificially low.

Most startups grow fast or die; if you die, you don't have to pay the employee, and if you grow fast, you'll be paying next year's salary out of next year's valuation, which should be 3x this year's. If your valuation grows 3x a year, the total cost in stock of a new hire's salary and overhead is 1.5 years' cost at the present valuation."}]}

Suppose the company wants to make a \"profit\" of 50% on the new hire mentioned above. So, subtract a third from 16.7%, and we have 11.1% as his \"retail\" price. Suppose further that he's going to cost $60k a year in salary and overhead, multiplied by 1.5, which equals $90k total. If the company's valuation is $2 million, $90k is 4.5%. Thus, 11.1% - 4.5% = an offer of 6.6%."}]}

I'm not claiming that stock grants can now be reduced to a formula; ultimately, you always have to make an educated guess. However, it is essential to understand what you are guessing. If you choose a number based on your gut feeling or a table of typical grant sizes supplied by a VC firm, be aware that those are merely estimates."}]}

This was an era when small firms making everything from cars to candy were getting consolidated into a new kind of corporation with national reach and huge economies of scale. You had to grow fast or die. Workers were for these companies what servers are for an Internet startup. A reliable supply was more important than low cost."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is one of the key focuses of Y Combinator in helping hackers succeed with their startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Teaching hackers how to deal with investors is probably the second most important thing we do at Y Combinator. The most important thing for a startup is to make something good. But everyone knows that's important. The dangerous thing about investors is that hackers don't know how little they know about this strange world."}]}

Not because they contribute more to the startup, but simply because they're least willing to move. They're rich. They're not going to move to Albuquerque just because there are some smart hackers there they could invest in. Whereas hackers will move to the Bay Area to find investors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do angel investors play in the success of startups in Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Though they're less well-known, angel investors are probably the more critical ingredient in creating Silicon Valley. Most companies that VCs invest in would never have made it that far if angels hadn't invested first. VCs say that between half and three-quarters of companies that raise Series A rounds have taken some outside investment already."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantages do angel investors have over venture capitalists when funding startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Angels are willing to fund riskier projects than VCs.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of funding was crucial for Google's early success before they received venture capital?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Google's story shows the key role angels play. A lot of people know Google raised money from Kleiner and Sequoia, but what most don't realize is how late. That VC round was a Series B round; the pre-money valuation was $75 million.

Essentially, startups are drawn to these hubs because other startups have already established themselves there, creating a cycle of innovation and investment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists receive more media attention than angel investors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If angels are so important, why do we hear more about VCs?

Both angels and VCs get deals almost exclusively through personal introductions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists prioritize having a strong brand compared to angel investors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason VCs want a strong brand is not to draw in more business plans over the transom, but so they can win deals when competing against other VCs. Whereas angels are rarely in direct competition because (a) they do fewer deals, (b) they're happy to split them, and (c) they invest at a point where the stream is broader."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are there so few venture capitalists who come from a hacking background?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're a hacker, here's a thought experiment you can run to understand why there are basically no hacker VCs: How would you like a job where you never got to make anything, but instead spent all your time listening to other people pitch (mostly terrible) projects, deciding whether to fund them, and sitting on their boards if you did? That would not be fun for most hackers. Hackers like to make things. This would be like being an administrator."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should founders understand about venture capitalists' skills and mindset when negotiating deals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because most VCs are a different species of people from founders, it's hard to know what they're thinking. If you're a hacker, the last time you had to deal with these guys was in high school. Maybe in college, you walked past their fraternity on your way to the lab. But don't underestimate them. They're as expert in their world as you are in yours. What they're good at is reading people and making deals work to their advantage. Think twice before you try to beat them at that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What investment strategy do some traders use to capitalize on sudden changes in stock prices?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some traders use a strategy similar to that of momentum investors to capitalize on sudden changes in stock prices. You can (or could once) make a lot of money by noticing these sudden changes. When a stock jumps upward, you buy, and when it suddenly drops, you sell. In effect, you're insider trading without knowing what you know. You just know someone knows something, and that's making the stock move."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do most venture investors approach identifying successful investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is how most venture investors operate.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence investor interest in startups, and how can this lead to rapid changes in a startup's perceived value?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Investors always say that what they really care about is the team. Actually, what they care most about is your traffic, then what other investors think, and then the team. If you don't yet have any traffic, they fall back on number two: what other investors think. This, as you can imagine, produces wild oscillations in the \"stock price\" of a startup. One week everyone wants you, and they're begging not to be cut out of the deal. But all it takes is for one big investor to cool on you, and the next week no one will return your phone calls. We regularly have startups go from hot to cold or cold to hot in a matter of days, and literally nothing has changed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two strategies for raising funds in a startup, and which one is recommended?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two strategies for raising funds in a startup. If you're feeling really confident, you can try to ride it. You can start by asking a comparatively lowly VC for a small amount of money, and then after generating interest there, ask more prestigious VCs for larger amounts, stirring up a crescendo of buzz, and then \"sell\" at the top. This is extremely risky and takes months even if you succeed. I wouldn't try it myself. My advice is to err on the side of safety: when someone offers you a decent deal, just take it and get on with building the company. Startups win or lose based on the quality of their product, not the quality of their funding deals."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do venture investors look for in startups when considering their investment potential?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Venture investors look for companies that could go public, as that is where the big returns are. They understand the odds of any individual startup going public are small, but they want to invest in those that at least have a chance of achieving this milestone."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria do venture capitalists typically use to decide which companies to invest in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Venture capitalists typically operate by investing in a variety of companies, most of which fail, while one or two may succeed significantly, such as Google. These few big wins compensate for the losses on their other investments. This means that most VCs will only invest in a company if it has the potential to become the next Google. They are not interested in companies that are merely safe bets for acquisition at around $20 million. There needs to be a chance, however small, of the company becoming really big."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors do angel investors consider when deciding to invest in a company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Angel investors consider several factors when deciding to invest in a company. They are willing to invest in a company where the most likely outcome is a $20 million acquisition if they can do it at a low enough valuation. However, they also favor companies that have the potential to go public. Therefore, having an ambitious long-term plan pleases everyone."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists prefer to invest in larger deals rather than smaller ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Venture capitalists prefer to invest in larger deals rather than smaller ones because they are running investment funds that typically amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. For instance, if a VC fund has $400 million to invest and there are 10 partners, each partner would need to invest $40 million. Additionally, VCs usually sit on the boards of the companies they fund. If the average deal size were only $1 million, each partner would have to sit on 40 boards, which would not be manageable. Therefore, they prefer bigger deals where they can allocate substantial amounts of money at once."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might venture capitalists view startups that require less funding as less attractive investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Venture capitalists don't regard you as a bargain if you don't need a lot of money. That may even make you less attractive because it means their investment creates less of a barrier to entry for competitors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might entrepreneurs choose to seek funding from angel investors for their inexpensive projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Angel investors are in a different position because they're investing their own money. They're happy to invest small amountsâsometimes as little as $20,000âas long as the potential returns look good enough. So if you're doing something inexpensive, consider approaching angel investors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence the valuation of a startup according to venture capitalists?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "VCs admit that valuations are an artifact. They decide how much money you need and how much of the company they want, and those two constraints yield a valuation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists prefer to invest at higher valuations compared to initial angel investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Valuations increase as the size of the investment does. A company that an angel is willing to put $50,000 into at a valuation of a million can't take $6 million from VCs at that valuation. That would leave the founders with less than a seventh of the company between them (since the option pool would also come out of that seventh). Most VCs wouldn't want that, which is why you never hear of deals where a VC invests $6 million at a pre-money valuation of $1 million."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might a high valuation be detrimental for startup founders seeking an acquisition?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since valuations are made up, founders shouldn't care too much about them. That's not the part to focus on. In fact, a high valuation can be a bad thing. If you take funding at a pre-money valuation of $10 million, you won't be selling the company for $20 million. You'll have to sell for over $50 million for the VCs to get even a 5x return, which is low to them. More likely, they'll want you to hold out for $100 million. But needing to get a high price decreases the chance of getting bought at all; many companies can buy you for $10 million, but only a handful can buy you for $100 million. And since a startup is like a pass/fail course for the founders, what you want to optimize is your chance of a good outcome, not the percentage of the company you keep."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates founders to pursue high valuations, and what potential pitfalls might this ambition lead to?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why do founders chase high valuations? They're driven by misplaced ambition. They feel they've achieved more if they get a higher valuation. They usually know other founders, and if they get a higher valuation, they can say, \"mine is bigger than yours.\" However, funding is not the real test. The real test is the final outcome for the founder, and getting too high a valuation may just make a good outcome less likely."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was a common misconception among investors regarding successful startups a decade ago?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ten years ago, investors were looking for the next Bill Gates. This was a mistake because Microsoft was a very anomalous startup. They started almost as a contract programming operation, and the reason they became huge was that IBM happened to drop the PC standard in their lap."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the approach of venture capitalists toward funding founders changed over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Historically, investors thought it was important for a founder to be an expert in business. So they were willing to fund teams of MBAs who planned to use the money to pay programmers to build their product for them. This is like funding Steve Ballmer in the hope that the programmer he'll hire is Bill Gatesâkind of backward, as the events of the Bubble showed. Now, most VCs know they should be funding technical guys. This is more pronounced among the very top funds; the lamer ones still want to fund MBAs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What additional support do investors provide to startups beyond financial investment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Investors do more for startups than just provide financial support. They are helpful in negotiating deals and arranging introductions, and some of the smarter ones, particularly angel investors, can offer valuable advice about the product."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might investors downplay their contributions to a startup's success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whatever help investors give a startup tends to be underestimated. It's to everyone's advantage to let the world think the founders thought of everything. The goal of the investors is for the company to become valuable, and the company seems more valuable if it appears that all the good ideas came from within."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do media narratives often overlook the contributions of early employees in startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This trend is compounded by the obsession that the press has with founders. In a company founded by two people, 10% of the ideas might come from the first person they hire. Arguably, they've done a bad job of hiring otherwise. And yet, this person will be almost entirely overlooked by the press."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common misconception do new founders have about the role and capabilities of established founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I say this as a founder: the contribution of founders is always overestimated. The danger here is that new founders, looking at existing founders, will think that they're supermen whom one couldn't possibly equal. Actually, they have a hundred different types of support people just offscreen making the whole show possible."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do many venture capitalists hesitate to take risks in their investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have been very surprised to discover how timid most VCs are.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference in risk-taking ability between venture capitalists and angel investors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As a friend of mine said, \"Most VCs can't do anything that would sound bad to the kind of doofuses who run pension funds.\" Angels can take greater risks because they don't have to answer to anyone."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why shouldn't founders take investor rejections personally?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some founders are quite dejected when they get turned down by investors. They shouldn't take it so much to heart. To start with, investors are often wrong. It's hard to think of a successful startup that wasn't turned down by investors at some point. Lots of VCs rejected Google. So, obviously, the reaction of investors is not a very meaningful test."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why can investors afford to overlook minor flaws in potential investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason investors can get away with this is that they see so many deals.

Youâd expect them to be cold and calculating, or at least businesslike, but often theyâre not. Iâm not sure if itâs their position of power that makes them this way or the large sums of money involved, but investment negotiations can easily turn personal. If you offend investors, theyâll leave in a huff."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key stages in the process of negotiating an investment or acquisition deal?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most deals for investment or acquisition happen in two phases. There's an initial phase of negotiation about the big questions. If this succeeds, you get a term sheet, so called because it outlines the key terms of a deal. A term sheet is not legally binding, but it is a definite step. It's supposed to mean that a deal is going to happen once the lawyers work out all the details. In theory, these details are minor ones; by definition, all the important points are supposed to be covered in the term sheet."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for founders to remain proactive and engaged after receiving a termsheet?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Inexperience and wishful thinking combine to make founders feel that when they have a termsheet, they have a deal. They want there to be a deal; everyone acts like they have a deal; so there must be a deal. But there isn't, and may not be for several months. A lot can change for a startup in several months. It's not uncommon for investors and acquirers to get buyer's remorse. So you have to keep pushing, keep selling, all the way to the close. Otherwise, all the \"minor\" details left unspecified in the termsheet will be interpreted to your disadvantage. The other side may even break the deal; if they do that, they'll usually seize on some technicality or claim you misled them, rather than admitting they changed their minds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can a startup maintain investor interest from the initial termsheet to closing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It can be hard to keep the pressure on an investor or acquirer all the way to the closing because the most effective pressure is competition from other investors or acquirers, and these tend to drop away when you get a termsheet. You should try to stay as close friends as you can with these rivals, but the most important thing is just to keep up the momentum in your startup. The investors or acquirers chose you because you seemed hot. Keep doing whatever made you seem hot. Keep releasing new features, keep getting new users, and keep getting mentioned in the press and in blogs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do deals with multiple venture capitalists tend to close more frequently?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Partly, I think this is an artifact of the rule I quoted earlier: after traffic, VCs care most about what other VCs think. A deal that has multiple VCs interested in it is more likely to close, so of the deals that close, more will have multiple investors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists prefer to share investment deals with other firms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main reason venture capitalists prefer to share investment deals with other firms is the fear of looking bad. If another firm shares the deal, then in the event of failure, it will seem to have been a prudent choiceâa consensus decision rather than just the whim of an individual partner."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do professional investors balance competition and cooperation in their relationships with each other and with founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In principle, investors are all competing for the same deals, but the spirit of cooperation is stronger than the spirit of competition. The reason, again, is that there are so many deals. Though a professional investor may have a closer relationship with a founder he invests in than with other investors, his relationship with the founder is only going to last a couple of years, whereas his relationship with other firms will last his whole career. There isn't so much at stake in his interactions with other investors, but there will be a lot of them. Professional investors are constantly trading little favors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do investors avoid competitive bidding in startup funding rounds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another reason investors stick together is to preserve the power of investors as a whole. So, as of this writing, you will not be able to get investors into an auction for your Series A round. They'd rather lose the deal than establish a precedent of VCs competitively bidding against one another. An efficient startup funding market may be coming in the distant future; things tend to move in that direction, but it's certainly not here now."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do startups tend to foster a strong sense of teamwork and alignment among their members?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason startups work so well is that everyone with power also has equity.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the motivations of larger scale investors differ from those of startup founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The problem is that larger scale investors don't have exactly the same motivation. Close, but not identical. They don't need any given startup to succeed, like founders do; they just need their portfolio as a whole to succeed. So, in borderline cases, the rational thing for them to do is to sacrifice unpromising startups."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do investors encourage startup founders to reject acquisition offers, despite the risks involved?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most people would rather have a 100% chance of $1 million than a 20% chance of $10 million. Investors are rich enough to be rational and prefer the latter. So they'll always tend to encourage founders to keep rolling the dice. If a company is doing well, investors will want founders to turn down most acquisition offers. Indeed, most startups that turn down acquisition offers ultimately do better. But it's still hair-raising for the founders because they might end up with nothing. When someone's offering to buy you for a price at which your stock is worth $5 million, saying no is equivalent to having $5 million and betting it all on one spin of the roulette wheel."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might selling a single private company's stock be a prudent decision, even if investors believe the company is undervalued?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Investors will tell you the company is worth more, and they may be right. But that doesn't mean it's wrong to sell. Any financial advisor who put all his clients' assets in the stock of a single private company would probably lose his license for it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does past success influence the opportunities available to venture capital firms in the funding market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Theyâre also in a business where winners tend to keep winning and losers tend to keep losing. When a VC firm has been successful in the past, everyone wants funding from them, so they get the pick of all the new deals. The self-reinforcing nature of the venture funding market means that the top ten firms live in a completely different world from, say, the hundredth. As well as being smarter, they tend to be calmer and more upstanding; they donât need to do iffy things to get an edge and donât want to because they have more brand to protect."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of fundraising on a startup's product development and time management?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Raising money is a huge time suck at just the point where startups can least afford it. It's not unusual for it to take five or six months to close a funding round; six weeks is fast. Additionally, raising money is not just something you can leave running as a background process. When you're raising money, it's inevitably the main focus of the company, which means building the product isn't."}]}

Since demo day occurs after 10 weeks, the company is now 18 weeks old. Raising money, rather than working on the product, has been the company's main focus for 44% of its existence. And mind you, this is an example where things turned out well."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of venture fund would be most beneficial for startups seeking quick investment decisions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Investors have no idea how much they damage the companies they invest in by taking so long to do it. But companies do. So there is a big opportunity here for a new kind of venture fund that invests smaller amounts at lower valuations but promises to either close or say no very quickly. If there were such a firm, I'd recommend it to startups in preference to any other, no matter how prestigious. Startups live on speed and momentum."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists often take a long time to finalize funding deals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason funding deals take so long to close is mainly that investors can't make up their minds. VCs are not big companies; they can do a deal in 24 hours if they need to. However, they usually let the initial meetings stretch out over a couple of weeks. The reason is the selection algorithm I mentioned earlier. Most don't try to predict whether a startup will win, but to notice quickly that it already is winning. They care what the market thinks of you and what other VCs think of you, and they can't judge those just from meeting you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might investors reject proposals in a way that isn't immediately obvious to entrepreneurs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because they're investing in things that (a) change fast and (b) they don't understand, a lot of investors will reject you in a way that can later be claimed not to have been a rejection. Unless you know this world, you may not even realize you've been rejected. Here's a VC saying no:"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it mean when investors say they need to see traction before investing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Translated into more straightforward language, this means: We're not investing in you, but we may change our minds if it looks like you're taking off. Sometimes they're more candid and say explicitly that they need to \"see some traction.\" They'll invest in you if you start to get lots of users. But so would any VC. So all they're saying is that you're still at square one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do most successful startups seek outside investment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some founders say, \"Who needs investors?\" Empirically, the answer seems to be: everyone who wants to succeed. Practically every successful startup takes outside investment at some point."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can outside investment impact a startup's competitive edge?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Outside investment can significantly impact a startup's competitive edge. If the answer is yes, and you don't take investment, then competitors who do will have an advantage over you. In the startup world, a little advantage can expand into a lot."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential implications of decreasing startup costs on the necessity for outside funding in competitive markets?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As it becomes cheaper to start a startup, it may become possible to succeed in a competitive market without outside funding. There are certainly costs associated with raising money, but as of this writing, the empirical evidence suggests that it's a net win."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common misconception that founders have about the role of investors in starting a company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A lot of founders approach investors as if they need their permission to start a companyâas if it were like getting into college. But you don't need investors to start most companies; they just make it easier."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of startup approach do investors find more appealing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Investors greatly prefer it if you don't need them. What excites them, both consciously and unconsciously, is the sort of startup that approaches them saying, \"The train's leaving the station; are you in or out?\" not the one saying, \"Please can we have some money to start a company?\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy should startups adopt when approaching venture capitalists to increase their chances of success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When approaching venture capitalists, startups should remember that VCs are skilled at reading people. Therefore, it is unwise to act tough unless you genuinely have the next Google on your hands; they will see through any facade in an instant. Instead of trying to project confidence, startups should always have a backup plan. Having an alternative strategy for getting started if any given investor says no is the best insurance against needing one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a recommended strategy for launching a startup with high initial costs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You shouldn't start a startup that's expensive to launch, because then you'll be at the mercy of investors. If you ultimately want to do something that will cost a lot, start by doing a cheaper subset of it and expand your ambitions when and if you raise more money."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities should a startup embody to survive in a challenging environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A startup should embody resilience and adaptability to survive in a challenging environment. Apparently, the most likely animals to be left alive after a nuclear war are cockroaches because they're so hard to kill. That's what you want to be as a startup, initially. Instead of a beautiful but fragile flower that needs to have its stem in a plastic tube to support itself, it's better to be small, ugly, and indestructible."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the most effective way to approach venture capitalists for funding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A few VCs have an email address you can send your business plan to, but the number of startups that get funded this way is basically zero. You should always get a personal introductionâand to a partner, not an associate."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What might indicate that a venture capitalist regrets a deal after it has been made?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Actually, this sounds to me like a VC who got buyer's remorse and then used a technicality to get out of the deal. But it's telling that it even seemed a plausible excuse."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some examples of situations where judgment is the primary goal and how is fairness ensured in these cases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first type of judgment, the type where judging you is the end goal, includes court cases, grades in classes, and most competitions. Such judgments can, of course, be mistaken, but because the goal is to judge you correctly, there's usually some kind of appeals process. If you feel you've been misjudged, you can protest that you've been treated unfairly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some examples of judgments that may not be primarily focused on the individual being assessed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But in fact, there is a second, much larger class of judgments where judging you is only a means to something else. These include college admissions, hiring and investment decisions, and, of course, the judgments made in dating. This kind of judgment is not really about you."}]}

But your goal here wasn't to provide a service estimating people's ability; it was to pick a team. If the difference between the 20th and 21st best players is less than the measurement error, you've still done that optimally."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can understanding the motivations behind others' judgments reduce personal feelings of rejection?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Our early training and our self-centeredness combine to make us believe that every judgment of us is about us. In fact, most aren't. This is a rare case where being less self-centered will make people more confident. Once you realize how little most people judging you care about judging you accuratelyâonce you realize that because of the normal distribution of most applicant pools, it matters least to judge accurately in precisely the cases where judgment has the most effectâyou won't take rejection so personally."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can changing your perspective on rejection affect your likelihood of experiencing it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Taking rejection less personally may help you to get rejected less often. If you think someone judging you will work hard to judge you correctly, you can afford to be passive. However, the more you realize that most judgments are greatly influenced by random, extraneous factorsâthat most people judging you are more like a fickle novel buyer than a wise and perceptive magistrateâthe more you understand that you can do things to influence the outcome."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can high school students improve their approach to college applications to better handle rejection?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One good place to apply this principle is in college applications. Most high school students applying to college do it with the usual child's mix of inferiority and self-centeredness: inferiority in that they assume that admissions committees must be all-seeing; self-centeredness in that they assume admissions committees care enough about them to dig down into their application and figure out whether they're good or not. These combine to make applicants passive in applying and hurt when they're rejected. If college applicants realized how quick and impersonal most selection processes are, they'd make more effort to sell themselves and take the outcome less personally."}]}

In fact, we've never even invited them to the demo days we organize for startups to present to investors. We invite Yahoo and Google and some other Internet companies, but we've never bothered to invite Microsoft. Nor has anyone there ever even sent us an email. They're in a different world."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When did Google establish itself as a leader in the tech industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When did Google take the lead? There will be a tendency to push it back to their IPO in August 2004, but they weren't setting the terms of the debate then. I'd say they took the lead in 2005. Gmail was one of the things that put them over the edge. Gmail showed they could do more than search."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Microsoft contribute to the development of Ajax technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ironically, Microsoft unintentionally helped create Ajax. The \"x\" in Ajax is from the XMLHttpRequest object, which lets the browser communicate with the server in the background while displaying a page. Originally, the only way to communicate with the server was to ask for a new page. XMLHttpRequest was created by Microsoft in the late 90s because they needed it for Outlook. What they didn't realize was that it would be useful to a lot of other people tooâin fact, to anyone who wanted to make web apps work like desktop ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does Javascript play in the functionality of Ajax, and how did Microsoft respond to its emergence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Javascript plays a critical role in the functionality of Ajax as it is the programming language that runs in the browser. Microsoft saw the danger of Javascript and tried to keep it broken for as long as they could."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the open source community respond to the challenges posed by Internet Explorer?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But eventually, the open source world won by producing JavaScript libraries that grew over the brokenness of Explorer the way a tree grows over barbed wire."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might large companies like Microsoft find it challenging to hire top-tier hackers despite their financial resources?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The surprising fact is that brilliant hackersâdangerously brilliant hackersâcan be had very cheaply, by the standards of a company as rich as Microsoft. They can't always be attracted to corporate environments due to a variety of factors, including a preference for independence, the allure of working in underground communities, or the desire for a less structured work environment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is Microsoft's biggest weakness according to the author?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Microsoft's biggest weakness is that they still don't realize how much they suck. They still think they can write software in-house. Maybe they can, by the standards of the desktop world. But that world ended a few years ago."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What defines a wise person according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What is wisdom? I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of situations. I'm not trying to make a deep point here about the true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word. A wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do wisdom and intelligence differ in their application to various types of problems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of problemsâwisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract ones. But that isn't true. Some wisdom has nothing to do with people; for example, the wisdom of the engineer who knows certain structures are less prone to failure than others. And certainly, smart people can find clever solutions to human problems as well as abstract ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to wisdom beyond just experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another popular explanation is that wisdom comes from experience while intelligence is innate. But people are not simply wise in proportion to how much experience they have. Other factors must contribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: a reflective disposition, for example."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between being wise and being smart?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Wisdom\" and \"smartness\" are both ways of saying someone knows what to do. The difference is that \"wise\" means one has a high average outcome across all situations, while \"smart\" means one does spectacularly well in a few. That is, if you had a graph in which the x-axis represented situations and the y-axis the outcome, the graph of the wise person would be high overall, and the graph of the smart person would have high peaks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How should intelligence and wisdom be evaluated in relation to their respective best and average states?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent at its best and character at its worst. Except you judge intelligence at its best and wisdom by its average. That's how the two are related: they're the two different senses in which the same curve can be high."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes a wise person from a smart person in terms of decision-making?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart person knows what to do in situations where few others could. We need to add one more qualification: we should ignore cases where someone knows what to do because they have inside information."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the nature of wisdom and its existence as a distinct quality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept: there's no such thing. \"Wise\" means somethingâthat one is on average good at making the right choice. But giving the name \"wisdom\" to the supposed quality that enables one to do that doesn't mean such a thing exists. To the extent \"wisdom\" means anything, it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline, experience, and empathy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the complexities and misconceptions surrounding the concept of intelligence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Likewise, though \"intelligent\" means something, we're asking for trouble if we insist on looking for a single thing called \"intelligence.\" And whatever its components, they're not all innate. We use the word \"intelligent\" as an indication of ability: a smart person can grasp things few others could. It does seem likely there's some inborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but this predisposition is not itself intelligence."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do we often perceive intelligence as an inborn trait rather than something influenced by experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people trying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it that are most measurable. A quality that's inborn will obviously be more convenient to work with than one that's influenced by experience and thus might vary in the course of a study. The problem comes when we drag the word \"intelligence\" over onto what they're measuring. If they're measuring something inborn, they can't be measuring intelligence. Three-year-olds aren't smart. When we describe one as smart, it's shorthand for \"smarter than other three-year-olds.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do wisdom and intelligence relate to the number of experiences or points on a developmental curve?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same curve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve decreases. If there's just one point, they're identical: the average and maximum are the same. But as the number of points increases, wisdom and intelligence diverge. Historically, the number of points on the curve seems to have been increasing: our ability is tested in an ever wider range of situations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the perceptions of wisdom and intelligence differ between the time of Confucius and Socrates and today?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seemed to have regarded wisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than we do today. Distinguishing between \"wise\" and \"smart\" is a modern habit."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the specialization of knowledge impact the distinction between high and average performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As knowledge gets more specialized, there are more points on the curve, and the distinction between the spikes and the average becomes sharper, like a digital image rendered with more pixels."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has society's admiration shifted from wisdom to intelligence over the centuries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Society seems to have voted for intelligence. We no longer admire the sageânot the way people did two thousand years ago. Now we admire the genius. In fact, the distinction we began with has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without being very wise, you can be wise without being very smart. That doesn't sound especially admirable. That gets you James Bond, who knows what to do in a lot of situations but has to rely on Q for the ones involving math."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between intelligence and wisdom, and can they coexist without conflict?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Intelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive. In fact, a high average may help support high peaks. However, there are reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between them. One example is very smart people, who are so often unwise that in popular culture this now seems to be regarded as the rule rather than the exception. Perhaps the absent-minded professor is wise in his way, or wiser than he seems, but he's not wise in the way Confucius or Socrates wanted people to be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What feelings do some mathematicians experience regarding their daily progress in their work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whereas a few years ago, I read an interview with a mathematician who said that most nights he went to bed discontented, feeling he hadn't made enough progress."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the growth of human knowledge resemble a fractal pattern?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Human knowledge seems to grow fractally. Time after time, something that seemed a small and uninteresting areaâexperimental error, evenâturns out, when examined up close, to have as much in it as all knowledge up to that point. Several of the fractal buds that have exploded since ancient times involve inventing and discovering new things. Math, for example, used to be something a handful of people did part-time. Now it's the career of thousands. In work that involves making new things, some old rules don't apply."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the author's approach to advising others differ from their feelings about writing essays?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Recently, I've spent some time advising people, and there I find the ancient rule still works: try to understand the situation as well as you can, give the best advice you can based on your experience, and then don't worry about it, knowing you did all you could. But I don't have anything like this serenity when I'm writing an essay. Then I'm worried. What if I run out of ideas? And when I'm writing, four nights out of five, I go to bed discontented, feeling I didn't get enough done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes the creative process of makers from the more duty-bound roles of judges or military officers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Someone like a judge or a military officer can, in much of his work, be guided by duty, but duty is no guide in making things. Makers depend on something more precarious: inspiration. And like most people who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried, not contented. In that respect, they're more like the small man of Confucius's day, always one bad harvest (or ruler) away from starvation. Except instead of being at the mercy of weather and officials, they're at the mercy of their own imagination."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it acceptable to feel discontented even when one is considered successful?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To me, it was a relief just to realize it might be okay to be discontented. The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of years of momentum behind it. If I was any good, why didn't I have the easy confidence winners are supposed to have? But that, I now believe, is like a runner asking, \"If I'm such a good athlete, why do I feel so tired?\" Good runners still get tired; they just get tired at higher speeds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the distinction between routine decision-making tasks and the expectation of innovation in ancient societies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whereas if you're doing the kind of work in which problems are presented to you and you have to choose between several alternatives, there's an upper bound on your performance: choosing the best every time. In ancient societies, nearly all work seems to have been of this type. The peasant had to decide whether a garment was worth mending, and the king whether or not to invade his neighbor, but neither was expected to invent anything. In principle, they could have; the king could have invented firearms, then invaded his neighbor. But in practice, innovations were so rare that they weren't expected of you, any more than goalkeepers are expected to score goals."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the perception of decision-making in high-stakes situations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In practice, it seemed as if there was a correct decision in every situation, and if you made it, you'd done your job perfectly, just as a goalkeeper who prevents the other team from scoring is considered to have played a perfect game."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the evolution of work and knowledge specialization affected the importance of intelligence compared to wisdom?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even now, most people do work in which problems are put before them, and they have to choose the best alternative. But as knowledge has grown more specialized, there are more and more types of work in which people have to create new things, and in which performance is therefore unbounded. Intelligence has become increasingly important relative to wisdom because there is more room for spikes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do intelligence and wisdom differ in their development and characteristics?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another sign we may have to choose between intelligence and wisdom is how different their recipes are. Wisdom seems to come largely from curing childish qualities, while intelligence largely comes from cultivating them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of self-control and experience in the pursuit of wisdom?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Recipes for wisdom, particularly ancient ones, tend to have a remedial character. To achieve wisdom, one must cut away all the debris that fills one's head on emergence from childhood, leaving only the important stuff. Both self-control and experience have this effect: to eliminate the random biases that come from your own nature and from the circumstances of your upbringing, respectively. That's not all wisdom is, but it's a large part of it. Much of what's in the sage's head is also in the head of every twelve-year-old. The difference is that in the head of the twelve-year-old, it's mixed together with a lot of random junk."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can individuals effectively cultivate their intelligence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The path to intelligence seems to be through working on hard problems. You develop intelligence as you might develop muscles, through exercise. But there can't be too much compulsion here. No amount of discipline can replace genuine curiosity. So cultivating intelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one's characterâsome tendency to be interested in certain types of thingsâand nurturing it. Instead of obliterating your idiosyncrasies in an effort to make yourself a neutral vessel for the truth, you select one and try to grow it from a seedling into a tree."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the main criticism of traditional educational methods in relation to developing intelligence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most of our educational traditions aim at wisdom. So perhaps one reason schools work badly is that they're trying to make intelligence using recipes for wisdom. Most recipes for wisdom have an element of subjection. At the very least, you're supposed to do what the teacher says. The more extreme recipes aim to break down your individuality the way basic training does. But that's not the route to intelligence. Whereas wisdom comes through humility, it may actually help, in cultivating intelligence, to have a mistakenly high opinion of your abilities because that encourages you to keep workingâideally until you realize how mistaken you were."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the main challenges associated with learning new skills later in life?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason it's hard to learn new skills late in life is not just that one's brain is less malleable. Another probably even worse obstacle is that one has higher standards."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the challenge teachers face in balancing encouragement and critical feedback in student learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A teacher has to walk a narrow path: you want to encourage kids to come up with things on their own, but you can't simply applaud everything they produce. You have to be a good audience: appreciative, but not too easily impressed. And that's a lot of work. You have to have a good enough grasp of kids' capacities at different ages to know when to be surprised."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of traditional educational methods in terms of student engagement and learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Traditional educational methods often position the student as the audience rather than as an active participant. The student's role is typically to absorb a prescribed body of material rather than to invent or engage creatively with the content. The term \"recitation,\" used in some college courses, is a remnant of this approach. The limitation of these traditional methods is that they overly rely on outdated practices that do not foster genuine engagement or critical thinking among students."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between intelligence and wisdom, and how do they differ in terms of their development and outcomes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I deliberately gave this essay a provocative title; of course, it's worth being wise. But I think it's important to understand the relationship between intelligence and wisdom, and particularly what seems to be the growing gap between them. That way, we can avoid applying rules and standards to intelligence that are really meant for wisdom. These two senses of \"knowing what to do\" are more different than most people realize. The path to wisdom is through discipline, and the path to intelligence through carefully selected self-indulgence. Wisdom is universal, and intelligence idiosyncratic. And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence, much of the time, leads to discontentment."}]}

A physicist friend recently told me half his department was on Prozac. Perhaps if we acknowledge that some amount of frustration is inevitable in certain kinds of work, we can mitigate its effects. Perhaps we can box it up and put it away some of the time, instead of letting it flow together with everyday sadness to produce what seems an alarmingly large pool. At the very least, we can avoid being discontented about being discontented."}]}

Every language probably has a word meaning \"how one feels when things are going well,\" but different cultures react differently when things go well. We react like children, with smiles and laughter. But in a more reserved society, or in one where life was tougher, the reaction might be a quiet contentment."}]}

The winners slow down the least. It's the same with most startups; the earliest phase is usually the most productive. That's when they have the really big ideas. Imagine what Apple was like when 100% of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do early stage startups differ from traditional perceptions of business culture?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The striking thing about this phase is that it's completely different from most people's idea of what business is like. If you looked in people's heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing \"business,\" you'd get images of people dressed up in suits, groups sitting around conference tables looking serious, PowerPoint presentations, and people producing thick reports for one another to read. Early stage startups are the exact opposite of this. And yet, they're probably the most productive part of the whole economy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the focus on appearances impact actual performance in individuals or products?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why the disconnect? I think there's a general principle at work here: the less energy people expend on performance, the more they expend on appearances to compensate. More often than not, the energy they expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performance worse. A few years ago, I read an article in which a car magazine modified the \"sports\" model of some production car to get the fastest possible standing quarter mile. You know how they did it? They cut off all the crap the manufacturer had bolted onto the car to make it."}]}

If there were good art, then people who liked it would have better taste than people who didn't. So, if you discard taste, you also have to discard the idea of art being good and artists being good at making it."}]}

When you're trying to make things, taste becomes a practical matter. You have to decide what to do next. Would it make the painting better if I changed that part? If there's no such thing as better, it doesn't matter what you do. In fact, it doesn't matter if you paint at all. You could just go out and buy a ready-made blank canvas. If there's no such thing as good, that would be just as great an achievement as the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Less laborious, certainly, but if you can achieve the same level of performance with less effort, surely that's more impressive, not less."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the effectiveness of art in engaging its audience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think the key to this puzzle is to remember that art has an audience. Art has a purpose, which is to interest its audience. Good art (like good anything) is art that achieves its purpose particularly well. The meaning of \"interest\" can vary. Some works of art are meant to shock, and others to please; some are meant to jump out at you, and others to sit quietly in the background. But all art has to work on an audience, andâhere's the critical pointâmembers of the audience share things in common."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do paintings that include faces tend to attract more interest from viewers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, nearly all humans find human faces engaging. It seems to be wired into us. Babies can recognize faces practically from birth. In fact, faces seem to have co-evolved with our interest in them; the face is the body's billboard. So, all other things being equal, a painting with faces in it will interest people more than one without."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the engagement with faces considered a universal trait among audiences when evaluating art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All humans find faces engagingâpractically by definition: face recognition is in our DNA. Therefore, having a notion of good art, in the sense of art that does its job well, doesn't require you to pick out a few individuals and label their opinions as correct. If audiences have a lot in common, you're not in a position of having to choose one out of a random set of individual biases because the set isn't random. No matter who you pick, they'll find faces engaging."}]}

But there might be other things they share in common with us. The most likely source of examples is math. I expect space aliens would agree with us most of the time about which of two proofs is better. ErdÅs thought so. He called a maximally elegant proof one out of God's book, and presumably, God's book is universal."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can we understand the concept of taste in relation to different audiences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Once you start talking about audiences, you don't have to argue simply that there are or aren't standards of taste. Instead, tastes are a series of concentric rings, like ripples in a pond. There are some things that will appeal to you and your friends, others that will appeal to most people your age, others that will appeal to most humans, and perhaps others that would appeal to most sentient beings (whatever that means)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria should we use to evaluate the quality of art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If good art is art that interests its audience, then when you talk about art being good, you also have to say for what audience. So is it meaningless to talk about art simply being good or bad? No, because one audience is the set of all possible humans. I think that's the audience people are implicitly talking about when they say a work of art is good: they mean it would engage any human."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some common visual preferences shared by humans?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That is a meaningful test because, although, like any everyday concept, \"human\" is fuzzy around the edges, there are a lot of things practically all humans have in common. In addition to our interest in faces, there's something special about primary colors for nearly all of us, because it's an artifact of the way our eyes work. Most humans will also find images of 3D objects engaging, because that also seems to be built into our visual perception."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can beauty in art be considered an objective property of objects rather than merely a subjective experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many philosophers have had a hard time believing it was possible for there to be objective standards for art. It seemed obvious that beauty, for example, was something that happened in the head of the observer, not something that was a property of objects. It was thus \"subjective\" rather than \"objective.\" However, if you narrow the definition of beauty to something that works a certain way on humans, and you observe how much humans have in common, it turns out to be a property of objects after all. You don't have to choose between something being a property of the subject or the object if subjects all react similarly. Being good art is thus a property of objects as much as, say, being toxic to humans is: it's good art if it consistently affects humans in a certain way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do artists manipulate viewer expectations through the presentation of their work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Artists manipulate viewer expectations through the presentation of their work in various ways. For one thing, artists, unlike apple trees, often deliberately try to trick us. Some tricks are quite subtle. For example, any work of art sets expectations by its level of finish. You don't expect photographic accuracy in something that looks like a quick sketch. So one widely used trick, especially among illustrators, is to intentionally make a painting or drawing look like it was done faster than it was. The average person looks at it and thinks: how amazingly skillful. It's like saying something clever in a conversation as if you'd thought of it on the spur of the moment, when in fact you'd worked it out the day before."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does brand recognition influence people's perception of art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For the average person, brand dominance overshadows all other factors in the judgment of art.

Most adults looking at art worry that if they don't like what they're supposed to, they'll be thought uncultured. This concern doesn't just affect what they claim to like; they actually make themselves like things they're supposed to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one develop a deeper appreciation for a famous painting beyond its initial fame?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, while anyone's reaction to a famous painting will be warped at first by its fame, there are ways to decrease its effects. One is to come back to the painting over and over. After a few days, the fame wears off, and you can start to see it as a painting. Another is to stand close. A painting familiar from reproductions looks more familiar from ten feet away; close in, you see details that get lost in reproductions, and which you're therefore seeing for the first time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two main types of errors that can affect one's perception of art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two main kinds of errors that get in the way of seeing a work of art: biases you bring from your own circumstances and tricks played by the artist. Tricks are straightforward to correct for; merely being aware of them usually prevents them from working. For example, when I was ten, I used to be very impressed by airbrushed lettering that looked like shiny metal. But once you study how it's done, you see that it's a pretty cheesy trickâone of the sort that relies on pushing a few visual buttons really hard to temporarily overwhelm the viewer. It's like trying to convince someone by shouting at them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one protect themselves from being deceived by manipulative art or presentations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The way to avoid being vulnerable to tricks is to explicitly seek out and catalog them. When you notice a whiff of dishonesty coming from some kind of art, stop and figure out what's going on. When someone is obviously pandering to an audience that's easily fooled, whether it's someone making shiny stuff to impress ten-year-olds or someone making conspicuously avant-garde stuff to impress would-be intellectuals, learn how they do it. Once you've seen enough examples of specific types of tricks, you start to become a connoisseur of trickery in general, just as professional magicians are."}]}

Roughly, it's something done with contempt for the audience. For example, the guys designing Ferraris in the 1950s were probably designing cars that they themselves admired. Whereas I suspect over at General Motors, the marketing people are telling the designers, \"Most people who buy SUVs do it to seem manly, not to drive off-road. So don't worry about the suspension; just make that sucker as big and tough-looking as you can.\""}]}

It's harder to escape the influence of your own circumstances, but you can at least move in that direction. The way to do it is to travel widely, in both time and space. If you go and see all the different kinds of things people like in other cultures and learn about all the different things people have liked in the past, you'll probably find it changes what you like. I doubt you could ever make yourself into a completely universal person, if only because you can only travel in one direction in time. But if you find a work of art that would appeal equally to your friends, to people in Nepal, and to the ancient Greeks, you're probably onto something."}]}

I think I've shown that there is such a thing as good art. It's art that interests its human audience, and since humans have a lot in common, what interests them is not random. Since there's such a thing as good art, there's also such a thing as good taste, which is the ability to recognize it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics define individuals who have a discerning taste in art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To put it more prosaically, they are the people who (a) are hard to trick, and (b) don't just like whatever they grew up with. If you could find people who had eliminated all such influences on their judgment, you'd probably still see variation in what they liked. But because humans have so much in common, you'd also find they agreed on a lot. They'd nearly all prefer the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to a blank canvas."}]}

Anyone who makes things knows intuitively that's not true. When you're trying to make art, the temptation to be lazy is as great as in any other kind of work. Of course, it matters to do a good job. And yet, you can see how great a hold \"taste is subjective\" has even in the art world by how nervous it makes people to talk about art being good or bad. Those whose jobs require them to judge art, like curators, mostly resort to euphemisms like \"significant,\" \"important,\" or (getting dangerously close) \"realized.\""}]}

The most important consequence of realizing there can be good art is that it frees artists to try to make it. To the ambitious kids arriving at art school this year, hoping one day to make great things, I say: don't believe it when they tell you this is a naive and outdated ambition. There is such a thing as good art, and if you try to make it, there are people who will notice."}]}

There are situations in which you want to avoid faces, precisely because they attract so much attention. But you can see how universally faces work by their prevalence in advertising."}]}

I was very impressed by the papers published in philosophy journals. They were so beautifully typeset, and their tone was just captivatingâalternately casual and buffer-overflowingly technical. A fellow would be walking along a street, and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon him. I didn't ever quite understand these papers, but I figured I'd get around to that later, when I had time to reread them more closely. In the meantime, I tried my best to imitate them. This was, I can now see, a doomed undertaking because they weren't really saying anything. No philosopher ever refuted another, for example, because no one said anything definite enough to refute. Needless to say, my imitations didn't say anything either."}]}

One trick is to ignore presentation. Whenever I see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: how much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty and frameless, and with no idea who painted it? If you walk around a museum trying this experiment, you'll find you get some truly startling results. Don't ignore this data point just because it's an outlier."}]}

Be careful to copy what makes them good, rather than their flaws. It's easy to be drawn into imitating flaws because they're easier to see, and of course easier to copy too. For example, most painters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries used brownish colors. They were imitating the great painters of the Renaissance, whose paintings by that time were brown with dirt. Those paintings have since been cleaned, revealing brilliant colors; their imitators are, of course, still brown."}]}

There don't seem to be many universities elsewhere that compare with the best in America, at least in technology."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of government policies aimed at equalizing university quality in Germany and the Netherlands?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In some countries, this is the result of a deliberate policy. The German and Dutch governments, perhaps from fear of elitism, try to ensure that all universities are roughly equal in quality. The downside is that none are especially good. The best professors are spread out instead of being concentrated as they are in the US. This probably makes them less productive because they don't have good colleagues to inspire them. It also means no one university will be good enough to act as a mecca, attracting talent from abroad and causing startups to form around it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the competition among US universities influence their quality compared to government-controlled institutions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Itâs natural for US universities to compete with one another because so many are private. To reproduce the quality of American universities, you probably also have to reproduce this competition. If universities are controlled by the central government, log-rolling will pull them all toward the mean: the new Institute of X will end up at the university in the district of a powerful politician, instead of where it should be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do startups in Europe face due to labor laws?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the biggest obstacles to creating startups in Europe is the attitude toward employment. The famously rigid labor laws hurt every company, but startups especially, because startups have the least time to spare for bureaucratic hassles."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between job security and employee performance across different professions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The problem is more than just that some startups might have a problem firing someone they needed to. Across industries and countries, there's a strong inverse correlation between performance and job security. Actors and directors are fired at the end of each film, so they have to deliver every time. Junior professors are fired by default after a few years unless the university chooses to grant them tenure. Professional athletes know they'll be pulled if they play badly for just a couple of games. At the other end of the scale (at least in the US) are auto workers, New York City schoolteachers, and civil servants, who are all nearly impossible to fire. The trend is so clear that you'd have to be willfully blind not to see it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does viewing work as a series of different types of activities rather than a lifetime commitment to one employer influence the decision to start a business?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even in the US, most kids graduating from college still think they're supposed to get jobs, as if you couldn't be productive without being someone's employee. But the less you identify work with employment, the easier it becomes to start a startup. When you see your career as a series of different types of work, instead of a lifetime's service to a single employer, there's less risk in starting your own company because you're only replacing one segment instead of discarding the whole thing."}]}

A year after the founding of Apple, Steve Wozniak still hadn't quit HP. He still planned to work there for life. When Jobs found someone to give Apple serious venture funding on the condition that Woz quit, he initially refused, arguing that he'd designed both the Apple I and the Apple II while working at HP, and there was no reason he couldn't continue."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do entrepreneurs face when trying to start a business in certain countries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the biggest challenges entrepreneurs face when trying to start a business in certain countries is the effort required just to establish a company. A friend of mine started a company in Germany in the early 90s and was shocked to discover, among many other regulations, that you needed $20,000 in capital to incorporate. That's one reason I'm not typing this on an Apfel laptop. Jobs and Wozniak couldn't have come up with that kind of money in a company financed by selling a VW bus and an HP calculator. We couldn't have started Viaweb either."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the fragility of young startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Young startups are fragile for several reasons. They are often started by individuals who may lack financial resources and confidence; they typically begin in marginal spaces and during spare time; they are initiated by people who are supposed to be engaged in other activities; and although they are businesses, their founders often know little about business operations. A society that trims its margins sharply will kill them all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy do successful startups use to launch their initial product?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What sustains a startup in the beginning is the prospect of getting their initial product out.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might a startup face more challenges in a small country compared to a larger market like America?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A startup might face more challenges in a small country compared to a larger market like America because, in America, the local market consists of 300 million people. It wouldn't work as well in Sweden. In a small country, a startup has a harder task: they have to sell internationally from the start."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does language diversity in the EU impact the competitiveness of software startups compared to those in the US?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The EU was designed partly to simulate a single, large domestic market. The problem is that the inhabitants still speak many different languages. So, a software startup in Sweden is still at a disadvantage relative to one in the US because they have to deal with internationalization from the beginning. It's significant that the most famous recent startup in Europe, Skype, worked on a problem that was intrinsically international."}]}

When I was a student in Italy in 1990, few Italians spoke English. Now, all educated people seem to be expected toâand Europeans do not like to seem uneducated. This is presumably a taboo subject, but if present trends continue, French and German will eventually go the way of Irish and Luxembourgish: they'll be spoken in homes and by eccentric nationalists."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the ease of starting a startup in America compared to other countries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups are easier to start in America because funding is easier to get. There are now a few VC firms outside the US, but startup funding doesn't only come from VC firms. A more important source, because it's more personal and comes earlier in the process, is money from individual angel investors. Google might never have gotten to the point where they could raise millions from VC funds if they hadn't first raised a hundred thousand from Andy Bechtolsheim. And he could help them because he was one of the founders of Sun. This pattern is repeated constantly in startup hubs. It's this pattern that contributes significantly to the ease of starting a startup in America compared to other countries."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key to fostering a successful startup ecosystem?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The good news is that all you have to do to get the process rolling is get those first few startups successfully launched.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do private universities contribute to the availability of venture capital in America?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "America's private universities are one reason there's so much venture capital. A lot of the money in VC funds comes from their endowments. So, another advantage of private universities is that a good chunk of the country's wealth is managed by enlightened investors."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the career decision-making process in the US differ from that in European countries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Compared to other industrialized countries, the US is disorganized about routing people into careers.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What underlying belief about individual roles in society influences the European approach to vocational training?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The European approach reflects the old idea that each person has a single, definite occupationâwhich is not far from the idea that each person has a natural \"station\" in life. If this were true, the most efficient plan would be to discover each person's station as early as possible so they could receive the training appropriate to it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates many students to enroll in CS PhD programs in the US, despite the primary focus on research?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, in theory, the purpose of a PhD program is to train you to do research. But fortunately, in the US, this is another rule that isn't very strictly enforced. In the US, most people in CS PhD programs are there simply because they wanted to learn more. They haven't decided what they'll do afterward. So, American grad schools spawn a lot of startups because students don't feel they're failing if they don't go into research."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might poor public school systems unintentionally prepare students for higher education?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Those worried about America's \"competitiveness\" often suggest spending more on public schools. But perhaps America's lousy public schools have a hidden advantage. Because they're so bad, the kids adopt an attitude of waiting for college. I did; I knew I was learning so little that I wasn't even learning what the choices were, let alone which to choose. This is demoralizing, but it does at least make you keep an open mind."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do American attitudes towards entrepreneurship compare to those in India and China?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "American attitudes towards entrepreneurship are often characterized by a greater willingness to take risks.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How have historical events influenced the perception of ambition in Europe compared to the United States?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I admit there seem to be different attitudes toward ambition in Europe and the US. In the US, it's okay to be overtly ambitious, and in most of Europe, it's not. But this can't be an intrinsically European quality; previous generations of Europeans were as ambitious as Americans. What happened? My hypothesis is that ambition was discredited by the terrible things ambitious people did in the first half of the twentieth century. Now swagger is out.

Palo Alto, the original ground zero, is about thirty miles away, and the present center is more like forty. So, people who come to work in Silicon Valley face an unpleasant choice: either live in the boring sprawl of the valley proper or live in San Francisco and endure an hour commute each way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What transportation preferences should be considered when designing a town to attract Silicon Valley-type individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The kind of people you want to attract to your Silicon Valley like to get around by train, bicycle, and on foot. So if you want to beat America, design a town that puts cars last. It will be a while before any American city can bring itself to do that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the challenges politicians face when setting capital gains tax rates to support startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To encourage startups, politicians should consider a low rate on capital gains. However, they are caught between a rock and a hard place: if they set the capital gains rate low, they risk being accused of creating \"tax breaks for the rich,\" but if they set it high, they may starve growing companies of investment capital. As Galbraith said, politics is a matter of choosing between the unpalatable and the disastrous. Many governments experimented with the disastrous in the twentieth century; now the trend seems to be toward the merely unpalatable."}]}

But a test that excludes Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Michael Dell can't be a good one. Plus, you can't get a visa for working on your own company, only for working as an employee of someone else's. And if you want to apply for citizenship, you daren't work for a startup at all, because if your sponsor goes out of business, you have to start over."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How could American immigration policy be improved to attract talented individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "American immigration policy keeps out most smart people and channels the rest into unproductive jobs.

It seems more accurate (or at least as accurate) to call the years after 1914 a nightmare than to call those before a dream. A lot of the optimism Europeans consider distinctly American is simply what they too were feeling in 1914."}]}

Above that, people get serious about tax avoidance. The reason is that the payoff for avoiding tax grows hyperexponentially (x/1-x for 0 < x < 1). If your income tax rate is 10%, moving to Monaco would only give you 11% more income, which wouldn't even cover the extra cost. If it's 90%, you'd get ten times as much income. And at 98%, as it was briefly in Britain in the 70s, moving to Monaco would give you fifty times as much income. It seems quite likely that European governments of the 70s never drew this curve."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the success of startup hubs in the US?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Observation bears this out: within the US, towns have become startup hubs if and only if they have both rich people and nerds.

The weather is terrible, particularly in winter, and there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is in Boston. Rich people don't want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca. So, while there are plenty of hackers who could start startups, there's no one to invest in them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are startup investors considered essential for the success of new technology ventures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startup investors are considered essential for the success of new technology ventures because they are a distinct type of wealthy individual who often have significant experience in the technology business.

My professor friends, when deciding where they'd like to work, consider one thing above all: the quality of the other faculty. What attracts professors is good colleagues. If you managed to recruit, en masse, a significant number of the best young researchers, you could create a first-rate university from nothing overnight. You could do that for surprisingly little. If you paid 200 people hiring bonuses of $3 million apiece, you could put together a faculty that would bear comparison with any in the world. From that point, the chain reaction would be self-sustaining. So whatever it costs to establish a mediocre university, for an additional half billion or so, you could have a great one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to a university's ability to foster startup growth in its surrounding community?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To spawn startups, a university has to be in a town that has attractions other than the university.

I think it's the feeling that each building is the work of a distinct group of people. A town with personality is one that doesn't feel mass-produced. So, if you want to make a startup hubâor any town to attract the \"creative class\"âyou probably have to ban large development projects.

It would be a waste of time to try to reverse the fortunes of a declining industrial town like Detroit or Philadelphia by encouraging startups, as those places have too much momentum in the wrong direction.

If you wanted to start a new fadâa new way to focus one's \"energy,\" for example, or a new category of things not to eatâthe Bay Area would be the place to do it. A place that tolerates oddness in the search for the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, because economically, that's what startups are. Most good startup ideas seem a little crazy; if they were obviously good ideas, someone would have done them already."}]}

It's because liberal cities tolerate odd ideas, and smart people, by definition, have odd ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics might limit a town's potential to become a successful startup hub?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A town that gets praised for being \"solid\" or representing \"traditional values\" may be a fine place to live, but it's unlikely to succeed as a startup hub. The characteristics that contribute to this limitation include a lack of innovation, resistance to change, and a culture that does not encourage risk-taking or entrepreneurship."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics do successful startup hubs share that help attract young people?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To attract the young, a town must have an intact center. In most American cities, the center has been abandoned, and the growth, if any, is in the suburbs. Most American cities have been turned inside out. But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco, not Boston, or Seattle. They all have intact centers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Which US cities are suggested as potential new Silicon Valleys and why?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Within the US, the two cities I think could most easily be turned into new Silicon Valleys are Boulder and Portland. Both have the kind of effervescent feel that attracts the young. They're each only a great university short of becoming a Silicon Valley, if they wanted to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the establishment of Silicon Valley in Palo Alto?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A great university near an attractive town. Is that all it takes? That was all it took to make the original Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley traces its origins to William Shockley, one of the inventors of the transistor. He did the research that won him the Nobel Prize at Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956, he moved to Palo Alto to do it. At the time, that was an odd thing to do. Why did he? Because he had grown up there and remembered how nice it was. Now Palo Alto is suburbia, but then it was a charming college townâa charming college town with perfect weather and San Francisco only an hour away."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Shockley Semiconductor influence the development of major technology companies in Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The companies that rule Silicon Valley now are all descended in various ways from Shockley Semiconductor. Shockley was a difficult man, and in 1957 his top peopleâ\"the traitorous eight\"âleft to start a new company, Fairchild Semiconductor. Among them were Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, and Eugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm Kleiner Perkins. Forty-two years later, Kleiner Perkins funded Google, and the partner responsible for the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 to work for Intel."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does the history of successful startups play in fostering the growth of new companies in Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Although many of the newest companies in Silicon Valley don't produce anything made of silicon, there always seem to be multiple links back to Shockley. There's a lesson here: startups beget startups. People who work for startups start their own. People who get rich from startups fund new ones. I suspect this kind of organic growth is the only way to produce a startup hub because it's the only way to grow the expertise you need."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key factors influencing the growth of a startup community in relation to a university?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The growth of a startup community in relation to a university has two important implications. The first is that you need time to grow a Silicon Valley. The university could be created in a couple of years, but the startup community around it has to grow organically. The cycle time is limited by the time it takes for a company to succeed, which probably averages about five years."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role did Shockley Semiconductor play in the development of new technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Shockley Semiconductor, though itself not very successful, was significant in the development of new technology. It brought a critical mass of experts in an important new technology together in a place they liked enough to stay."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the structure of companies in Silicon Valley during Shockley's era differ from the modern startup model?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of Silicon Valley's biggest advantages is its venture capital firms. This was not a factor in Shockley's day because VC funds didn't exist. In fact, Shockley Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor were not startups at all in our sense; they were subsidiaries of Beckman Instruments and Fairchild Camera and Instrument, respectively. Those companies were apparently willing to establish subsidiaries wherever the experts wanted to live."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture investors prefer to fund startups located near them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Venture investors, however, prefer to fund startups within an hour's drive. For one, they're more likely to notice startups nearby. When they do notice startups in other towns, they prefer them to move. They don't want to have to travel to attend board meetings, and in any case, the odds of succeeding are higher in a startup hub."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do venture firms influence the formation and growth of startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The centralizing effect of venture firms is a double one: they cause startups to form around them, and those startups draw in more startups through acquisitions. Although the first may be weakening because it's now so cheap to start some startups, the second seems as strong as ever. Three of the most admired \"Web 2.0\" companies were started outside the usual startup hubs, but two of them have already been reeled in through acquisitions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors could allow a new tech hub to compete with or surpass Silicon Valley?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Such centralizing forces make it harder for new Silicon Valleys to get started, but by no means is it impossible. Ultimately, power rests with the founders. A startup with the best people will beat one with funding from famous VCs, and a startup that is sufficiently successful would never have to move. So, a town that could exert enough pull over the right people could resist and perhaps even surpass Silicon Valley."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How many individuals are suggested as potentially sufficient to transform Buffalo into a significant startup hub?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's interesting to consider how low this number could be made. I suspect five hundred would be enough, even if they could bring no assets with them. Probably just thirty, if I could pick them, would be enough to turn Buffalo into a significant startup hub."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the funding process for academic research differ from that of startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bureaucrats manage to allocate research funding moderately well, but only because (like an in-house VC fund) they outsource most of the work of selection. A professor at a famous university who is highly regarded by his peers will get funding, pretty much regardless of the proposal. That wouldn't work for startups, whose founders aren't sponsored by organizations and are often unknowns."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the startup landscape in New York compare to that of Boston in terms of quantity and industry focus?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups are more prevalent in Boston than in New York, with less than a tenth as many per capita in New York. The focus of New York startups tends to be in fields like finance and media, which are generally considered less technical compared to the industries prevalent in Boston."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of releasing a minimal version of a product early in the development process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By \"release early,\" I don't mean you should release something full of bugs, but that you should release something minimal. Users hate bugs, but they don't seem to mind a minimal version 1 if there's more coming soon."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for startups to release their initial software version quickly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast. One is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for a startup or not. I've been repeating that since 1993, and I haven't seen much since to contradict it. I've seen a lot of startups die because they were too slow to release stuff, and none because they were too quick."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it risky for web startups to make assumptions about their users' preferences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now, a web startup may have almost half a million unique visitors a month. Who are all those people? They have no idea. No web startup does. And since you don't know your users, it's dangerous to guess what they'll like. It's better to release something and let them tell you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What benefits did Wufoo gain by releasing their form-builder before the complete database?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Wufoo took this to heart and released their form-builder before the underlying database. You can't even drive the thing yet, but 83,000 people came to sit in the driver's seat and hold the steering wheel. Wufoo got valuable feedback from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they rewrote their software not to. If they'd waited to release everything at once, they wouldn't have discovered this problem until it was more deeply wired in."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for startups to prioritize a quick initial release, even without users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even if you have no users, it is still important to release quickly because, for a startup, the initial release acts as a shakedown cruise. If anything major is brokenâif the idea's no good, for example, or the founders hate one anotherâthe stress of getting that first version out will expose it. And if you have such problems, you want to find them early."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the impact of releasing a project early on the motivation and urgency of the team?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that it makes you work harder. When you're working on something that isn't released, problems are intriguing. In something that's out there, problems are alarming. There is a lot more urgency once you release. And I think that's precisely why people put it off. They know they'll have to work a lot harder once they do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an important consideration to keep in mind when adopting the \"release early\" strategy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course, \"release early\" has a second component, without which it would be bad advice. If you're going to start with something that doesn't do much, you better improve it fast."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does regular practice in a skill, like running or hacking, influence motivation and creativity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As with exercise, improvements beget improvements. If you run every day, you'll probably feel like running tomorrow. But if you skip running for a couple of weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself out. So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the more ideas you'll have. You should make your system better at least in some small way every day or two."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is continuous improvement on a website important for user engagement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Continuous improvement on a website is important for user engagement because it serves not only as a means of development but also as a form of marketing. Users love a site that's constantly improving, and in fact, they expect it to evolve. Imagine visiting a site that seemed very good, and then returning two months later to find that not one thing had changed. Wouldn't it start to seem lame?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can a company foster customer loyalty and reduce the need for advertising?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Customers will like you even better when you improve in response to their comments because they are used to companies ignoring them. If you're the rare exceptionâa company that actually listensâyou'll generate fanatical loyalty. You won't need to advertise because your users will do it for you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often become complacent with existing products and overlook potential improvements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People often become complacent with existing products and overlook potential improvements because they get used to how things are. Once a product surpasses the stage where it has glaring flaws, users start to acclimate to it, and gradually whatever features it possesses become its identity. For example, I doubt many people at Yahoo (or Google, for that matter) realized how much better webmail could be until Paul Buchheit showed them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset can help enhance creativity and drive continuous improvement in your work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think the solution is to assume that anything you've made is far short of what it could be. Force yourself, as a sort of intellectual exercise, to keep thinking of improvements. Ok, sure, what you have is perfect. But if you had to change something, what would it be?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two reasons someone might think their product is finished?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations: (a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination. Experience suggests (b) is a thousand times more likely."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key principle that drives the success of startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Improving constantly is an instance of a more general rule: make users happy. One thing all startups have in common is that they can't force anyone to do anything. They can't force anyone to use their software, and they can't force anyone to do deals with them. A startup has to sing for its supper. That's why the successful ones make great things. They have to, or die."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do users play in the success or failure of a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you're running a startup, you feel like a little bit of debris blown about by powerful winds. The most powerful wind is users. They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with most startups. Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than any other. If they take you up, no competitor can keep you down."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to design a website for casual visitors rather than just for those who are highly engaged?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I like the wind metaphor because it reminds you how impersonal the stream of traffic is. The vast majority of people who visit your site will be casual visitors. It's for them that you have to design your site. The people who really care will find what they want by themselves."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset do most web visitors have when navigating online content?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The median visitor will arrive with their finger poised on the Back button. Think about your own experience: most links you follow lead to something disappointing. Anyone who has used the web for more than a couple of weeks has been conditioned to expect that many online contents may not meet their expectations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of enterprise content management solutions for businesses?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Enterprise content management solutions for businesses enable organizations to unify people, content, and processes to minimize business risk, accelerate time-to-value, and sustain lower total cost of ownership."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to have a clear and compelling description of your company for various stakeholders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A clear and compelling description of your company is important not just for users, but for all stakeholders: investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and even current employees. You probably shouldn't even start a company to do something that can't be described compellingly in one or two sentences."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy should you use to maximize visitor engagement on your website?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other thing I repeat is to give people everything you've got right away. If you have something impressive, try to put it on the front page, because that's the only one most visitors will see. Though indeed there's a paradox here: the more you push the good stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore further."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key principle in fiction writing that can also apply to effectively communicating the purpose of a website?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is \"show, don't tell.\" Don't say that a character's angry; have him grind his teeth or break his pencil in half. Nothing will explain what your site does so well as using it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of measuring conversion rates on a website?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The industry term here is \"conversion.\" The job of your site is to convert casual visitors into usersâwhatever your definition of a user is. You can measure this in your growth rate. Either your site is catching on, or it isn't, and you must know which. If you have decent growth, you'll win in the end, no matter how obscure you are now. And if you don't, you need to fix something."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common advice do entrepreneurs often receive regarding their worries in a startup environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another thing I find myself saying a lot is, \"Don't worry.\" Actually, it's more often, \"Don't worry about this; worry about that instead.\" Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear the wrong things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why should startups not be overly concerned about competition from big companies like Google?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A lot of startups worry, \"What if Google builds something like us?\" Actually, big companies are not the ones you have to worry aboutânot even Google. The people at Google are smart, but no smarter than you; they're not as motivated because Google is not going to go out of business if this one product fails. Even at Google, they have a lot of bureaucracy to slow them down."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of competition poses a greater threat to startups than established companies like Google?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What you should fear, as a startup, is not the established players, but other startups you don't know exist yet. They're far more dangerous than Google because, like you, they're cornered animals."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should entrepreneurs consider regarding competition when pursuing a new idea?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Entrepreneurs should consider not only what competitors are currently doing but also what they might be doing in the future. A corollary is that you shouldn't relax just because you have no visible competitors yet. No matter what your idea is, there's someone else out there working on the same thing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might the increasing number of startups not indicate a saturated market for new businesses?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people are doing it. But I disagree with Caterina Fake when she says that makes this a bad time to start a startup. More people are starting startups, but not as many more as could. Most college graduates still think they have to get a job. The average person can't ignore something that's been beaten into their head since they were three just because serving web pages recently got a lot cheaper."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the main reasons startups fail, and which one is considered the most detrimental?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Competitors are not the biggest threat to startups. Way more startups hose themselves than get crushed by competitors. There are a lot of ways to do it, but the three main ones are internal disputes, inertia, and ignoring users. Each is, by itself, enough to kill you. But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoring users. If you want a recipe for a startup that's going to die, here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know everyone is going to love, and that's what they're going to build, no matter what."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do successful companies do when their initial business plans fail?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Almost everyone's initial plan is broken.

You'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking. This principle is very powerful. It's why the best abstract painting still falls short of Leonardo, for example. And it applies to startups too.

This may work in biotech, where a lot of startups simply commercialize existing research, but in software, you want to invest in students, not professors. Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by people who dropped out of school to do it. What students lack in experience, they more than make up for in dedication."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some of the unique challenges faced by startup founders compared to regular employees?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Running a startup is like walking on your hands: it's possible, but it requires extraordinary effort. If an ordinary employee were asked to do the things a startup founder has to, they would be very indignant. Imagine if you were hired at some big company, and in addition to writing software ten times faster than you'd ever had to before, they expected you to answer support calls, administer the servers, design the website, cold-call customers, find the company office space, and go out and get everyone lunch."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do entrepreneurs face when building a startup compared to working in a larger company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Building a startup presents unique challenges compared to working in a larger company.

In a startup, there's always some disaster happening, so if you're the least bit inclined to find an excuse to quit, there's always one readily available."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does a lack of commitment impact success in startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A lack of commitment can significantly impact success in startups. If you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurting you long before you actually quit. Everyone who deals with startups knows how important commitment is, so if they sense you're ambivalent, they won't give you much attention. If you lack commitment, you'll just find that, for some mysterious reason, good things happen to your competitors but not to you. It will seem to you that you're unlucky."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What attitude towards commitment can hinder a startup's chances of attracting investors or acquirers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At Y Combinator, we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have the attitude that they're going to give this startup thing a shot for three months, and if something great happens, they'll stick with itâ\"something great\" meaning either that someone wants to buy them or invest millions of dollars in them. But if this is your attitude, \"something great\" is very unlikely to happen to you, because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of commitment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence an acquirer's decision to purchase a company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An acquirer's decision to purchase a company is influenced by several factors. If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what, they'll be more likely to buy you. This is because if they don't buy you and you do stick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and they'll be left wishing they'd bought you earlier. The same applies to investors. What really motivates investors, even big VCs, is not the hope of good returns, but the fear of missing out."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities should an entrepreneur possess to succeed in a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You have to be the right kind of determined, though. I carefully chose the word \"determined\" rather than \"stubborn,\" because stubbornness is a disastrous quality in a startup. You have to be determined but flexible, like a running back. A successful running back doesn't just put his head down and try to run through people. He improvises: if someone appears in front of him, he runs around them; if someone tries to grab him, he spins out of their grip; he'll even run in the wrong direction briefly if that will help. The one thing he'll never do is stand still."}]}

He said he didn't think so because the whole social thing was tapped out. Really? So in a hundred years, the only social networking sites will be Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, and Del.icio.us? Not likely."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What mindset prevents us from recognizing potential innovations in seemingly saturated markets?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason we don't see the opportunities all around us is that we adjust to however things are and assume that's how things have to be. For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to make a better search engine than Google. Surely that field, at least, is tapped out. Really? In a hundred yearsâor even twentyâare people still going to search for information using something like the current Google? Even Google probably doesn't think that."}]}

Sometimes you hear people saying, \"All these guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed. How many little startups are Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?\" That sounds cleverly skeptical, but I can prove it's mistaken. No one proposes that there's some limit to the number of people who can be employed in an economy consisting of big, slow-moving companies with a couple thousand people each. Why should there be any limit to the number who could be employed by small, fast-moving companies with ten each? It seems to me the only limit would be the number of people who want to work that hard."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How should startup founders manage their inherent optimism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startup founders are naturally optimistic; they wouldn't pursue this path otherwise. However, you should treat your optimism the way you'd treat the core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that's also very dangerous. You have to build a shield around it, or it will fry you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is adaptability crucial in a startup environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Adaptability is crucial in a startup environment because you tend to be pushing the limits of whatever you're doing.

If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it's not going to happen. The VCs who say they're going to invest in you aren't. The company that says they're going to buy you isn't. The big customer who wants to use your system in their whole company won't. Then, if things work out, you can be pleasantly surprised."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it beneficial to continue exploring other options even after agreeing to a deal?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage to have kept looking because you'll get better terms. Deals are dynamic; unless you're negotiating with someone unusually honest, there's not a single point where you shake hands and the deal's done. There are usually a lot of subsidiary questions to be cleared up after the handshake, and if the other side senses weaknessâif they sense you need this dealâthey will be very tempted to screw you in the details."}]}

It is also palpably short. You're given this marvelous thing, and then poof, it's taken away. You can see why people invent gods to explain it. But even to people who don't believe in gods, life commands respect. There are times in most of our lives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has a sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious.

That's not what makes startups worth the trouble. What's important about startups is the speed. By compressing the dull but necessary task of making a living into the smallest possible time, you show respect for life, and there is something grand about that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a more effective strategy for startups to avoid failure when launching a product?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups can fail by releasing products that are full of bugs and not fixing them quickly enough.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do users prioritize when evaluating the quality of a website?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Users prioritize the rate of improvement when evaluating the quality of a website. A website is different from a book, movie, or desktop application in this respect. Users judge a site not as a single snapshot, but as an animation with multiple frames. Of the two, I'd say the rate of improvement is more important to users than where you currently are."}]}

Maybe what you have is so valuable that visitors should gladly register to get at it. But they've been trained to expect the opposite. Most of the things they've tried on the web have been disappointingâespecially those that required registration."}]}

They don't make their money (if they make money) off their median investments. In a typical fund, half the companies fail, most of the rest generate mediocre returns, and one or two \"make the fund\" by succeeding spectacularly. So if they miss just a few of the most promising opportunities, it could hose the whole fund."}]}

No, it turns out, the Earth is not the center of the universe â not even the center of the solar system. No, it turns out, humans are not created by God in his own image; they are just one species among many, descended not merely from apes, but from microorganisms.

So difficult that there's probably room to discard more.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of the phrase \"never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The phrase \"never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence\" is significant because it encourages us to consider that not all negative actions are driven by ill intent; sometimes, they stem from a lack of skill or understanding. Although the origin of the phrase is unknown, it conveys a powerful idea about human behavior and decision-making. Its more general version serves as a reminder to approach situations with empathy and to avoid jumping to conclusions about others' motives."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the argument for the patentability of software in relation to physical inventions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One thing I do feel pretty certain of is that if you're against software patents, you're against patents in general. Gradually, our machines consist more and more of software. Things that used to be done with levers, cams, and gears are now done with loops, trees, and closures. There's nothing special about physical embodiments of control systems that should make them patentable, and the software equivalent not."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the term \"algorithm\" avoided in patent applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Patent lawyers still have to pretend that's what they're doing when they patent algorithms. You must not use the word \"algorithm\" in the title of a patent application, just as you must not use the word \"essays\" in the title of a book. If you want to patent an algorithm, you have to frame it as a computer system executing that algorithm. Then it's mechanical; phew. The default euphemism for algorithm is \"system and method.\" Try a patent search for that phrase and see how many results you get."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the main challenges facing the patent office in relation to software patents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think the problem is more with the patent office than the concept of software patents. Whenever software meets government, bad things happen because software changes fast and government changes slowly. The patent office has been overwhelmed by both the volume and the novelty of applications for software patents, and as a result, they've made a lot of mistakes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a major issue with the patent granting process at the USPTO?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most common issue is granting patents that shouldn't be granted. To be patentable, an invention has to be more than new; it also has to be non-obvious. This, especially, is where the USPTO has been dropping the ball. Slashdot has an icon that expresses the problem vividly: a knife and fork with the words \"patent pending\" superimposed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What perception do Slashdot readers have about stories related to patents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slashdot readers have a negative perception of stories related to patents.

Any online store that kept people's shipping addresses would have implemented this. The reason Amazon did it first was not that they were especially smart, but because they were one of the earliest sites with enough clout to force customers to log in before they could buy something."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What concerns do hackers have about the USPTO's understanding of software patents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We, as hackers, know the USPTO is letting people patent the knives and forks of our world. The problem is, the USPTO is not made up of hackers. They're probably good at judging new inventions for casting steel or grinding lenses, but they don't understand software yet."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges does the patent office face in keeping up with rapidly evolving technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At this point, an optimist would be tempted to add, \"but they will eventually.\" Unfortunately, that might not be true. The problem with software patents is an instance of a more general one: the patent office takes a while to understand new technology. If so, this problem will only get worse because the rate of technological change seems to be increasing. In thirty years, the patent office may understand the sort of things we now patent as software, but there will be other new types of inventions they understand even less."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes Amazon's enforcement of its patent from the defensive use of patents by other companies like Microsoft?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Where Amazon went over to the dark side was not in applying for the patent, but in enforcing it. A lot of companies (Microsoft, for example) have been granted large numbers of preposterously over-broad patents, but they keep them mainly for defensive purposes. Like nuclear weapons, the main role of big companies' patent portfolios is to threaten anyone who attacks them with a counter-suit. Amazon's suit against Barnes & Noble was thus the equivalent of a nuclear first strike."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Amazon's legal actions regarding the one-click patent impact its reputation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That suit probably hurt Amazon more than it helped them. Barnes & Noble was a lame site; Amazon would have crushed them anyway. To attack a rival they could have ignored, Amazon put a lasting black mark on their own reputation. Even now, I think if you asked hackers to free-associate about Amazon, the one-click patent would turn up in the first ten topics."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two different interpretations of the question regarding the morality of applying for patents within the current legal system?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are really two variants of that question, and people answering it often aren't clear in their own minds which they're answering. There's a narrow variant: is it bad, given the current legal system, to apply for patents? And also a broader one: is it bad that the current legal system allows patents?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the societal norms regarding self-defense in preindustrial societies like medieval Europe?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In preindustrial societies like medieval Europe, when someone attacked you, you didn't call the policeâthere were no police. When attacked, you were supposed to fight back, and there were conventions about how to do it. Was this wrong? That's two questions: was it wrong to take justice into your own hands, and was it wrong that you had to? We tend to say yes to the second, but no to the first. If no one else will defend you, you have to defend yourself."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do patents play in the competitive landscape of business?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Patents play a crucial role in the competitive landscape of business. Just as checking is an integral part of hockey, patents are essential in the business arena. If a company refuses to utilize patents effectively, it risks losing its competitive edge. Under the present rules, patents are part of the game."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is patent infringement typically not a concern for funded startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We tell the startups we fund not to worry about infringing patents because startups rarely get sued for patent infringement. There are only two reasons someone might sue you: for money or to prevent you from competing with them. Startups are too poor to be worth suing for money. In practice, they don't seem to get sued much by competitors, either. They don't get sued by other startups because (a) patent suits are an expensive distraction, and (b) since the other startups are as young as they are, their patents probably haven't issued yet."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might established software companies choose to acquire startups rather than pursue legal action against them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Established software companies might choose to acquire startups rather than pursue legal action against them because, in the software business, startups do not seem to get sued much by established competitors. Despite all the patents Microsoft holds, I don't know of an instance where they sued a startup for patent infringement. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle don't win by winning lawsuits; that's too uncertain. They win by locking competitors out of their sales channels. If you do manage to threaten them, they're more likely to buy you than sue you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it indicate about a company's market position when they resort to filing patent lawsuits against smaller competitors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you read of big companies filing patent suits against smaller ones, it's usually a big company on the way down, grasping at straws. For example, Unisys's attempts to enforce their patent on LZW compression illustrate this trend. When you see a big company threatening patent suits, it's a signal to sell. When a company starts fighting over intellectual property, it's a sign they've lost the real battle for users."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it indicate about a company's competitive position when it resorts to threatening patent lawsuits?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A company that sues competitors for patent infringement is like a defender who has been beaten so thoroughly that he turns to plead with the referee. You don't do that if you can still reach the ball, even if you genuinely believe you've been fouled. So, a company threatening patent suits is a company in a weakened competitive position."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the response of the VP from the larger company after being told their patent on online ordering was considered invalid?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When we were working on Viaweb, a bigger company in the e-commerce business was granted a patent on online ordering, or something like that. I got a call from a VP there asking if we'd like to license it. I replied that I thought the patent was completely bogus and would never hold up in court. \"Ok,\" he replied. \"So, are you guys hiring?\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the recommended approach to dealing with patent infringement concerns for startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In other words, no one will sue you for patent infringement until you have money, and once you have money, people will sue you whether they have grounds to or not. So I advise fatalism. Don't waste your time worrying about patent infringement. You're probably violating a patent every time you tie your shoelaces. At the start, at least, just worry about making something great and getting lots of users. If you grow to the point where anyone considers you worth attacking, you're doing well."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do we recommend that startups apply for patents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We do advise the companies we fund to apply for patents, but not so they can sue competitors. Successful startups either get bought or grow into big companies. If a startup wants to grow into a big company, they should apply for patents to build up the patent portfolio they'll need to maintain an armed truce with other big companies. If they want to get bought, they should apply for patents because patents are part of the mating dance with acquirers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence acquirers' decisions to buy startups instead of building their own solutions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most startups that succeed do so by getting bought, and most acquirers care about patents. Startup acquisitions are usually a build-vs-buy decision for the acquirer: should we buy this little startup or build our own? Two factors, especially, make them decide not to build their own: if they already have a large and rapidly growing user base, and if they have a fairly solid patent application on critical parts of their software."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might large companies opt to acquire technology rather than develop it in-house?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason large companies might prefer to acquire technology rather than develop it in-house is that if they built their own, they might screw it up. However, few big companies are smart enough yet to admit this to themselves. It's usually the acquirer's engineers who are asked how hard it would be for the company to build their own, and they tend to overestimate their abilities."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the impact of patents on the software industry, according to the author's observations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Frankly, it surprises me how small a role patents play in the software business. It's kind of ironic, considering all the dire things experts say about software patents stifling innovation, but when one looks closely at the software business, the most striking thing is how little patents seem to matter."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What legal actions can companies take against competitors in response to perceived technological advancements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In other fields, companies regularly sue competitors for patent infringement. For example, the airport baggage scanning business was for many years a cozy duopoly shared between two companies, InVision and L-3. In 2002, a startup called Reveal appeared, with new technology that let them build scanners a third the size. They were sued for patent infringement before they'd even released a product."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an example of a major company filing a patent lawsuit against a smaller startup, and what might have motivated that decision?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You rarely hear that kind of story in our world. The one example I've found is, embarrassingly enough, Yahoo, which filed a patent suit against a gaming startup called Xfire in 2005. Xfire doesn't seem to be a very big deal, and it's hard to say why Yahoo felt threatened. Xfire's VP of engineering had worked at Yahoo on similar stuffâin fact, he was listed as an inventor on the patent Yahoo sued overâso perhaps there was something personal about it. My guess is that someone at Yahoo goofed. At any rate, they didn't pursue the suit very vigorously."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might patents in software be considered less valuable compared to patents in other engineering fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason is that software is so complicated that patents by themselves are not worth very much. I may be maligning other fields here, but it seems that in most types of engineering, you can hand the details of some new technique to a group of medium-high quality people and get the desired result. For example, if someone develops a new process for smelting ore that gets a better yield, and you assemble a team of qualified experts and tell them about it, they'll be able to achieve the same yield. This doesn't seem to work in software. Software is so subtle and unpredictable that \"qualified experts\" don't get you very far."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might a team of qualified experts struggle against a team of less experienced but highly motivated individuals in software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's why we rarely hear phrases like \"qualified expert\" in the software business. What that level of ability can get you is, say, to make your software compatible with some other piece of softwareâin eight months, at enormous cost. To do anything harder, you need individual brilliance. If you assemble a team of qualified experts and tell them to make a new web-based email program, they'll get their asses kicked by a team of inspired nineteen-year-olds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What makes design a skill that can be developed and understood, similar to how electricity was once perceived?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Design is a definite skill. It's not just an airy intangible. Things always seem intangible when you don't understand them. Electricity seemed an airy intangible to most people in 1800. Who knew there was so much to know about it? So it is with design. Some people are good at it, and some people are bad at it, and there's something very tangible they're good or bad at."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is design particularly important in software development compared to physical product development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason design counts so much in software is probably that there are fewer constraints than on physical products. Building physical products is expensive and dangerous. The space of possible choices is smaller; you tend to have to work as part of a larger group, and you're subject to a lot of regulations. You don't have any of that if you and a couple of friends decide to create a new web-based application."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the success of small software companies against larger competitors beyond patents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because there's so much scope for design in software, a successful application tends to be way more than the sum of its patents. What protects little companies from being copied by bigger competitors is not just their patents, but the thousand little things that the big company will get wrong if they try."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do startups typically compete with established companies in the software industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The second reason patents don't count for much in our world is that startups rarely attack big companies head-on, the way Reveal did. In the software business, startups beat established companies by transcending them. Startups don't build desktop word processing programs to compete with Microsoft Word."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do large companies typically respond to startup competition, and what implications does this have for the startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fortunately for startups, big companies are extremely good at denial. If you take the trouble to attack them from an oblique angle, they'll meet you halfway and maneuver to keep you in their blind spot. To sue a startup would mean admitting it was dangerous, and that often means seeing something the big company doesn't want to see. IBM used to sue its mainframe competitors regularly, but they didn't bother much about the microcomputer industry because they didn't want to see the threat it posed. Companies building web-based apps are similarly protected from Microsoft, which even now doesn't want to imagine a world in which Windows is irrelevant."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What potential consequences could Microsoft face if they decided to challenge Linux on patent grounds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Steve Ballmer coyly left open the possibility of attacking Linux on patent grounds. But I doubt Microsoft would ever be so stupid. They'd face the mother of all boycotts, and not just from the technical community in general; a lot of their own people would rebel."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the principle-driven behavior of good hackers in the software industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good hackers care a lot about matters of principle, and they are highly mobile. If a company starts misbehaving, smart people won't work there. For some reason, this seems to be more true in software than in other businesses. I don't think it's because hackers have intrinsically higher principles so much as that their skills are easily transferable. Perhaps we can split the difference and say that mobility gives hackers the luxury of being principled."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Google's \"don't be evil\" policy impact its corporate culture and decision-making?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Google's \"don't be evil\" policy may, for this reason, be the most valuable thing they've discovered. It's very constraining in some ways. If Google does do something evil, they get doubly whacked for it: once for whatever they did, and again for hypocrisy. But I think it's worth it. It helps them to hire the best people, and it's better, even from a purely selfish point of view, to be constrained by principles than by stupidity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is there limited legal action among software companies despite the prevalence of patents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not sure what the proportions are of the preceding three ingredients, but the custom among the big companies seems to be not to sue the small ones, and the startups are mostly too busy and too poor to sue one another. So, despite the huge number of software patents, there's not a lot of suing going on, with one exception: patent trolls."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do patent trolls resemble historical practices of wealth extraction from merchants?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What companies like Forgent do is actually the proto-industrial way. In the period just before the Industrial Revolution, some of the greatest fortunes in countries like England and France were made by courtiers who extracted some lucrative right from the crownâlike the right to collect taxes on the import of silkâand then used this to squeeze money from the merchants in that business. So when people compare patent trolls to the mafia, they're more right than they know, because the mafia too are not merely bad, but bad specifically in the sense of being an obsolete business model."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do big companies face when dealing with patent trolls, and how might the legal landscape change in response?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Patent trolls seem to have caught big companies by surprise. In the last couple of years, they've extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from them. Patent trolls are hard to fight precisely because they create nothing. Big companies are safe from being sued by other big companies because they can threaten a counter-suit. But because patent trolls don't make anything, there's nothing they can be sued for. I predict this loophole will get closed fairly quickly, at least by legal standards. It's clearly an abuse of the system, and the victims are powerful."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the basis for most people's opinions on the subject, according to the author?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One thing I can say is that 99.9% of the people who express opinions on the subject do so not based on such research, but out of a kind of religious conviction. At least, that's the polite way of putting it; the colloquial version involves speech coming out of organs not designed for that purpose."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of obtaining a patent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The purpose of obtaining a patent is to encourage innovation. You don't get a patent for nothing. In return for the exclusive right to use an idea, you have to disclose the details of that idea to the public."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the establishment of patents reflect the evolution of societal structures and the role of central governments in protecting individual rights?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Before patents, people protected ideas by keeping them secret. With patents, central governments said, in effect, if you tell everyone your idea, we'll protect it for you. There is a parallel here to the rise of civil order, which happened at roughly the same time. Before central governments were powerful enough to enforce order, rich people had private armies. As governments got more powerful, they gradually compelled magnates to cede most responsibility for protecting them. (Magnates still have bodyguards, but no longer to protect them from other magnates.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential drawbacks of implementing a \"need to know\" policy in organizations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even worse than the spectacular abuses might be the overall decrease in efficiency that would accompany increased secrecy. As anyone who has dealt with organizations that operate on a \"need to know\" basis can attest, dividing information up into little cells is terribly inefficient. The flaw in the \"need to know\" principle is that you don't have access to all the information necessary to make informed decisions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do patents impact innovation in the software industry, particularly for startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the software business, I know from experience whether patents encourage or discourage innovation, and the answer is the type that people who like to argue about public policy least like to hear: they don't affect innovation much, one way or the other. Most innovation in the software business happens in startups, and startups should simply ignore other companies' patents. At least, that's what we advise, and we bet money on that advice."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary purpose of patents for startups in the context of acquisition?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The primary purpose of patents for startups, in the context of acquisition, is as an element of the mating dance with acquirers. There, patents do help a little. They encourage innovation indirectly, as they give more power to startups, which is where, pound for pound, the most innovation happens. However, even in the mating dance, patents are of secondary importance; it matters more to create something great and attract a lot of users."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What questions should corporate development teams consider when evaluating potential projects with developers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Instead of the canonical \"Could you build this?\" maybe the corporate development team should be asking \"Will you build this?\" or even \"Why haven't you already built this?\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it difficult to assess the quality of design skills in the industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Design ability is so hard to measure that you can't even trust the design world's internal standards. You can't assume that someone with a degree in design is any good at design, or that an eminent designer is any better than his peers. If that worked, any company could build products as good as Apple's just by hiring sufficiently qualified designers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can big technology companies effectively combat patent trolls without relying on government intervention?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If big companies don't want to wait for the government to take action, there is a way to fight back themselves. For a long time, I thought there wasn't because there was nothing to grab onto. But there is one resource patent trolls need: lawyers. Big technology companies, between them, generate a lot of legal business. If they agreed among themselves never to do business with any firm employing anyone who had worked for a patent troll, either as an employee or as outside counsel, they could probably starve the trolls of the lawyers they need."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the proposed search result sorting method differ from traditional methods used by search engines and advertisers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The idea is basically that you sort search results not in order of textual \"relevance\" (as search engines did then) nor in order of how much advertisers bid (as Overture did), but in order of the bid times the number of transactions. Ordinarily, you'd do this for shopping searches; though, in fact, one of the features of our scheme is that it automatically detects which searches are shopping searches."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can search results be improved to avoid prioritizing low-quality sites that bid the highest?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you just order the results in order of bids, you can make the search results useless because the first results could be dominated by low-quality sites that bid the most. However, if you order results by bid multiplied by transactions, far from selling out, you're getting a more accurate reflection of quality."}]}

While everyone is focused on different approaches now, few were aware of this back then. We were quite excited when we figured out what seemed to us the optimal way of doing shopping searches."}]}

For him, I now realize, this was supposed to be one of those meetings when you check out a company you've pretty much decided to buy, just to make sure they're okay guys. We weren't expected to do more than chat and seem smart and reasonable. He must have been dismayed when I jumped up to the whiteboard and launched into a presentation of our exciting new technology."}]}

I missed that after we sold Viaweb, and for all the years after, I always had a background process running, looking for something we could do together. There is definitely an aspect of a band reunion to Y Combinator. Every couple of days, I slip and call it \"Viaweb.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated the author to start Viaweb?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Viaweb was started very explicitly to make money. I was sick of living from one freelance project to the next and decided to just work as hard as I could until I'd made enough to solve the problem once and for all. Viaweb was sometimes fun, but it wasn't designed for fun, and mostly it wasn't. I'd be surprised if any startup is. All startups are mostly schleps."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated the founders to start Y Combinator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The real reason we started Y Combinator is neither selfish nor virtuous. We didn't start it mainly to make money; we have no idea what our average returns might be and won't know for years. Nor did we start YC mainly to help out young would-be founders, though we do like the idea and comfort ourselves occasionally with the thought that if all our investments tank, we will thus have been doing something unselfish. (It's oddly nondeterministic.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates the initiative to encourage more startups among talented individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We did it because it seems like such a great hack. There are thousands of smart people who could start companies and don't, and with a relatively small amount of force applied at just the right place, we can spring on the world a stream of new startups that might otherwise not have existed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a more realistic approach to dealing with procrastination?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most people who write about procrastination discuss how to cure it. But this is, strictly speaking, impossible. There are an infinite number of things you could be doing. No matter what you work on, you're not working on everything else. So the question is not how to avoid procrastination, but how to procrastinate well."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the different types of procrastination and how can they be classified?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are three variants of procrastination, depending on what you do instead of working on something: you could work on (a) nothing, (b) something less important, or (c) something more important. That last type, Iâd argue, is good procrastination."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the typical behavior of the \"absent-minded professor\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"absent-minded professor\" is someone who forgets to shave, eat, or even look where he's going while he's thinking about some interesting question. His mind is absent from the everyday world because it's hard at work in another."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes type-C procrastinators from others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Type-C procrastinators are distinguished by their tendency to prioritize larger, more significant tasks over smaller ones. That's the sense in which the most impressive people I know are all procrastinators: they put off working on small stuff to work on big stuff."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What types of tasks are considered \"small stuff\" that are unlikely to be remembered after one's death?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What is \"small stuff?\" Roughly, it refers to work that has zero chance of being mentioned in your obituary. It's hard to say at the time what will turn out to be your best work (will it be your magnum opus on Sumerian temple architecture, or the detective thriller you wrote under a pseudonym?), but there's a whole class of tasks you can safely rule out: shaving, doing your laundry, cleaning the house, writing thank-you notesâanything that might be called an errand."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might it be necessary to be assertive or ruthless when trying to accomplish important tasks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Being assertive or ruthless can be necessary when trying to accomplish important tasks. The people who want you to do the errands may not think it's good, but you probably have to annoy them if you want to get anything done. Even the mildest-seeming people, if they want to do real work, often have a certain degree of ruthlessness when it comes to avoiding errands."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the consequences of procrastinating on certain types of errands?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some errands, like replying to letters, go away if you ignore them (perhaps taking friends with them). Others, like mowing the lawn or filing tax returns, only get worse if you put them off. In principle, it shouldn't work to put off the second kind of errand. You're going to have to do whatever it is eventually. Why not (as past-due notices are always saying) do it now?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might it be beneficial to postpone errands in favor of focusing on a creative project?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reason it pays to put off even those errands is that real work needs two things errands don't: big chunks of time and the right mood. If you get inspired by some project, it can be a net win to blow off everything you were supposed to do for the next few days to work on it. Yes, those errands may cost you more time when you finally get around to them. But if you get a lot done during those few days, you will be net more productive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of uninterrupted work time in achieving creative success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, it may not be a difference in degree, but a difference in kind. There may be types of work that can only be done in long, uninterrupted stretches, when inspiration hits, rather than dutifully in scheduled little slices. Empirically, it seems to be so. When I think of the people I know who've done great things, I don't imagine them dutifully crossing items off to-do lists. I imagine them sneaking off to work on some new idea."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does interrupting someone with synchronous tasks affect their productivity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Conversely, forcing someone to perform errands synchronously is bound to limit their productivity. The cost of an interruption is not just the time it takes, but that it breaks the time on either side in half. You probably only have to interrupt someone a couple of times a day before they're unable to work on hard problems at all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact do early hires have on the productivity and focus of a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Early hires are most productive at the very beginning when they're just a couple of guys in an apartment. The main reason may be that there's no one to interrupt them yet. In theory, it's good when the founders finally get enough money to hire people to do some of the work for them. But it may be better to be overworked than interrupted. Once you dilute a startup with ordinary office workersâwith type-B procrastinatorsâthe whole company starts to resonate at their frequency. They're interrupt-driven, and soon you are too."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common distractions do people use to avoid pursuing their creative goals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Errands are so effective at killing great projects that a lot of people use them for that purpose. Someone who has decided to write a novel, for example, will suddenly find that the house needs cleaning. People who fail to write novels don't do it by sitting in front of a blank page for days without writing anything. They do it by feeding the cat, going out to buy something they need for their apartment, meeting a friend for coffee, and checking email. \"I don't have time to work,\" they say. And they don't; they've made sure of that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a suggested remedy for feeling unmotivated or creatively blocked when lacking a dedicated workspace?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A suggested remedy for feeling unmotivated or creatively blocked when lacking a dedicated workspace is to visit the places where famous people worked and see how unsuitable they were."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the most deceptive form of procrastination and why is it considered dangerous?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most dangerous form of procrastination is unacknowledged type-B procrastination because it doesn't feel like procrastination. You're \"getting things done,\" just the wrong things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between to-do lists and type-B procrastination?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Any advice about procrastination that concentrates on crossing things off your to-do list is not only incomplete but positively misleading if it doesn't consider the possibility that the to-do list is itself a form of type-B procrastination. In fact, \"possibility\" is too weak a word. Nearly everyone's is. Unless you're working on the biggest things you could be working on, you're type-B procrastinating, no matter how much you're getting done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenging question should ambitious individuals confront, despite its discomfort?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most people will shy away from this question.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do young professionals and graduate students often face regarding their work preferences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you're young, especially, you often find yourself working on stuff you don't really likeâbecause it seems impressive, for example, or because you've been assigned to work on it. Most grad students are stuck working on big problems they don't really like, and grad school is thus synonymous with procrastination."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do people often prefer to tackle smaller problems over larger ones in their work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even when you like what you're working on, it's easier to get yourself to work on small problems than big ones. Why is it so hard to work on big problems? One reason is that you may not get any reward in the foreseeable future. If you work on something you can finish in a day or two, you can expect to have a nice feeling of accomplishment fairly soon. If the reward is indefinitely far in the future, it seems less real."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological barrier often prevents individuals from pursuing large projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another reason people don't work on big projects is, ironically, fear of wasting time. What if they fail? Then all the time they spent on it will be wasted. (In fact, it probably won't be, because work on hard projects almost always leads somewhere.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What emotional experience does one encounter when confronted with overwhelming criticism or pressure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thereâs an almost physical pain in facing them. Itâs like having a vacuum cleaner hooked up to your imagination. All your initial ideas get sucked out immediately, and you donât have any more, and yet the vacuum cleaner is still sucking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How should one approach tackling a significant challenge without becoming overwhelmed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can't look at a big problem too directly in the eye. You have to approach it somewhat obliquely. But you have to adjust the angle just right: you have to be facing the big problem directly enough that you catch some of the excitement radiating from it, but not so much that it paralyzes you. You can tighten the angle once you get going, just as a sailboat can sail closer to the wind once it gets underway."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategies can help individuals tackle large projects effectively?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To tackle large projects effectively, individuals can employ several strategies. First, it can be helpful to work on small tasks that could grow into larger projects. Alternatively, one might take on successively larger tasks or share the workload with collaborators. It's important to recognize that relying on these strategies is not a sign of weakness; in fact, some of the best work has been accomplished this way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some successful individuals feel guilty about neglecting smaller tasks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I talk to people who've managed to make themselves work on big things, I find that they all blow off errands and all feel guilty about it. I don't think they should feel guilty. There's more to do than anyone could manage. So, someone doing the best work they can is inevitably going to leave a lot of errands undone. It seems a mistake to feel bad about that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one effectively overcome procrastination?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think the way to \"solve\" the problem of procrastination is to let delight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you. Work on an ambitious project you really enjoy, and sail as close to the wind as you can, and you'll leave the right things undone."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors are contributing to the decreasing costs of starting a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money because it's getting so cheap to start a startup. The four causes are: open source, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware geometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free if you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot cheaper."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the initial major expenses for your startup in 1995?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When we started our startup in 1995, our three biggest expenses were as follows: We had to pay $5,000 for the Netscape Commerce Server, the only software that then supported secure HTTP connections. We paid $3,000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 MB of memory. Lastly, we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some advantages of starting a tech project today compared to the past?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now you can get all three for nothing. You can get the software for free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first server; and if you make something good, you can generate ten times as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got through the print media."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the approach to software development in startups evolved over the past decade?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At most startups ten years ago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in C++. Now, the same work might be done by one or two using Python or Ruby."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What alternative model for software development is suggested in response to the trend of outsourcing to countries like India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would outsource their development to India. I think a better model for the future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development to a more powerful language instead. A lot of well-known applications are now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer. And one guy is more than 10x cheaper than ten because (a) he won't waste any time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can pay himself nothing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists sometimes face challenges in investing the full amount they wish into startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Venture capitalists sometimes face challenges in investing the full amount they wish into startups because starting a startup is relatively inexpensive. As a result, venture capitalists often want to invest more money than the startups are willing to accept. VCs typically prefer to invest several million dollars at a time. However, as one VC mentioned after a startup he funded only wanted to take about half a million, \"I don't know what we're going to do. Maybe we'll just have to give some of it back.\" This means they might have to return some of the fund to the institutional investors who supplied it, as it wouldn't be possible to invest the entire amount."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact has the Sarbanes-Oxley Act had on public companies and their corporate officers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed after the Bubble, drastically increases the regulatory burden on public companies. In addition to the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a year, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate officers. An experienced CFO I know said flatly, \"I would not want to be CFO of a public company now.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What concerns are raised about the effectiveness of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in attracting qualified CFOs to public companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area where you can't go too far. But you can go too far in any law, and this remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have. This CFO is both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know. If Sarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public companies, that's proof enough that it's broken."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the Sarbanes-Oxley Act influenced the behavior of venture capitalists and the path to success for startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now. For all practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought. This means VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3 person startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100 million to acquire. They didn't mean to be in this business; it's just what their business has evolved into."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are acquirers increasingly choosing to buy startups directly instead of waiting for venture capitalists to invest?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Acquirers have begun to realize they can buy wholesale. Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups they want more expensive? Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't want anyway. The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR departments. What they really want is the software and the developers, and that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated software and developers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What stage of funding do companies prefer to acquire startups, and why is this strategy considered effective?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They are quite explicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point where they would do a Series A round. (The Series A round is the first round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first year.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology companies will no doubt try to duplicate, unless they want to have still more of their lunch eaten by Google."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do ordinary employees face when considering startup acquisitions at companies like Google?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the people there are rich or expect to be when their options vest.

This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to destroy the IPO market. Since the IPO market was practically dead when it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are startups considered fragile and important for economic growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups are fragile plantsâseedlings, in fact. These seedlings are worth protecting because they grow into the trees of the economy. Much of the economy's growth is their growth. I think most politicians realize that, but they don't realize just how fragile startups are and how easily they can become collateral damage of laws meant to fix some other problem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential consequences of neglecting or harming the startup industry compared to more established industries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Neglecting or harming the startup industry can have serious consequences, as startups often make very little noise when they are affected. If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll hear about it. However, if you inadvertently squash the startup industry, the result may simply be that the founders of the next Google remain in grad school instead of starting a company."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What alternative funding strategy could benefit both founders and venture capitalists during a Series A round?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My second suggestion may seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash out partially in the Series A round. At the moment, when VCs invest in a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued, and all the money goes to the company. They could buy some stock directly from the founders as well."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists typically restrict founders from receiving financial compensation until a company is sold or goes public?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this. They don't want founders to get a penny until the company is sold or goes public. VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll have less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might allowing founders to sell stock early be beneficial for a company's risk alignment with venture capitalists?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Allowing founders to sell a little stock early would generally be better for the company because it would cause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the VCs'. As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend to be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would prefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, while the VCs can afford to be \"rational\" and prefer the latter."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are many founders choosing to sell their companies early rather than pursue Series A funding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies early instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up front. That first million is just worth so much more than the subsequent ones. If founders could sell a little stock early, they'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger outcome."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the arrangement with angel investors benefit both the founders and the investors in the startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The angel investors who funded our startup allowed the founders to sell some stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. The angels made a huge return on that investment, so they were happy. For us founders, it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness of a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a motivator."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivations drove the summer founders in their entrepreneurial pursuits?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The summer founders were, as a rule, very idealistic. They also wanted very much to get rich. These qualities might seem incompatible, but they're not. These founders want to get rich, but they want to do it by changing the world. They wouldn't (well, seven of the eight groups wouldn't) be interested in making money by speculating in stocks. They want to make something people use."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities make founders more successful in achieving their goals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think this makes them more effective as founders. As hard as people will work for money, they'll work harder for a cause. Since success in a startup depends so much on motivation, the paradoxical result is that the people likely to make the most money are those who aren't in it just for the money."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do founders often feel fearful of competitors when starting their businesses?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Considering that the summer founders are the sharks in this ocean, we were surprised how frightened most of them were of competitors. But now that I think of it, we were just as frightened when we started Viaweb. For the first year, our initial reaction to news of a competitor was always: we're doomed. Just as a hypochondriac magnifies his symptoms until he's convinced he has some terrible disease, when you're not used to competitors, you magnify them into monsters."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are competitors usually not as threatening to startups as they might appear?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's a handy rule for startups: competitors are rarely as dangerous as they seem. Most will self-destruct before you can destroy them. And it certainly doesn't matter how many of them there are, any more than it matters to the winner of a marathon how many runners are behind him."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why should startups prioritize experimentation with their software design over addressing scalability, internationalization, and security in the initial stages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's why we advise groups to ignore issues like scalability, internationalization, and heavy-duty security at first. I can imagine an advocate of \"best practices\" saying these ought to be considered from the start. And he'd be right, except that they interfere with the primary function of software in a startup: to be a vehicle for experimenting with its own design. Having to retrofit internationalization or scalability is a pain, certainly. The only bigger pain is not needing to, because your initial version was too big and rigid to evolve into something users wanted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do startups often outperform larger companies in innovation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I suspect this is another reason startups beat big companies. Startups can be irresponsible and release version 1s that are light enough to evolve. In big companies, all the pressure is in the direction of over-engineering."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What types of assistance did the groups seek during the summer?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One thing we were curious about this summer was where these groups would need help. That turned out to vary a lot. Some we helped with technical adviceâfor example, about how to set up an application to run on multiple servers. Most we helped with strategy questions, like what to patent, what to charge for, and what to give away. Nearly all wanted advice about dealing with future investors: how much money they should take and what kind of terms they should expect?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What benefits did the summer founders gain from observing each other's presentations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perhaps watching each other's presentations helped them see what they'd been doing wrong. Just as happens in college, the summer founders learned a lot from one anotherâmaybe more than they learned from us. A lot of the problems they face are the same, from dealing with investors to hacking JavaScript."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do startups face when collaborating with large companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups face several challenges when collaborating with large companies. Many venture capitalists (VCs) have noted that groups who have dealt with big companies often find that these companies operate at an incredibly slow pace. This is to be expected; if large companies were not inefficient, there would be less opportunity for startups to thrive. Additionally, there are the usual nightmares associated with server issues."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the primary reasons for the potential failure of startups, according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In short, the disasters this summer were just the usual childhood diseases. Some of this summer's eight startups will probably die eventually; it would be extraordinary if all eight succeeded. But what kills them will not be dramatic, external threats, but a mundane, internal one: not getting enough done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What benefits did the investors experience in their relationship with the founders compared to a typical employer-employee dynamic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So far, though, the news is all good. In fact, we were surprised how much fun the summer was for us. The main reason was how much we liked the founders. They're so earnest and hard-working. They seem to like us too. And this illustrates another advantage of investing over hiring: our relationship with them is way better than it would be between a boss and an employee. Y Combinator ends up being more like an older brother than a parent."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did you come to realize your own network's influence and your age in relation to your friends' success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I was surprised by how much time I spent making introductions. Fortunately, I discovered that when a startup needed to talk to someone, I could usually get to the right person by at most one hop. I remember wondering, \"How did my friends get to be so eminent?\" and a second later realizing: \"Shit, I'm forty.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unexpected benefits did the three-month batch format provide for Y Combinator's investment strategy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another surprise was that the three-month batch format, which we were forced into by the constraints of the summer, turned out to be an advantage. When we started Y Combinator, we planned to invest the way other venture firms do: as proposals came in, we'd evaluate them and decide yes or no. The SFP was just an experiment to get things started. But it worked so well that we plan to continue using this format in the future."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do weekly dinners benefit startups struggling with social isolation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Several groups said our weekly dinners saved them from a common problem afflicting startups: working so hard that one has no social life. (I remember that part all too well.) This way, they were guaranteed a social event at least once a week."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Y Combinator's approach to startup investment differ from that of traditional incubators?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've heard Y Combinator described as an \"incubator.\" Actually, we're the opposite: incubators exert more control than ordinary VCs, and we make a point of exerting less. Among other things, incubators usually make you work in their officeâthat's where the word \"incubator\" comes from. That seems the wrong model. If investors get too involved, they smother one of the most powerful forces in a startup: the feeling that it's your own company."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the effectiveness of incubators for startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Incubators were conspicuous failures during the Bubble. There's still debate about whether this was because of the Bubble or because they're a bad idea. My vote is that they're a bad idea. I think they fail because they select for the wrong people. When we were starting a startup, we would never have taken funding from an \"incubator.\" We can find office space, thanks; just give us the money. And people with that attitude are the ones likely to succeed in startups."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence the attitudes of founders, nature or nurture?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As with most nature/nurture questions, the answer is probably: some of each. However, my main conclusion from the summer is that there's more environment in the mix than most people realize. I could see that from how the founders' attitudes were shaped by their surroundings."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the individuals adapt to their newfound freedom after years of following directives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "During the summer, most were emerging from twenty or so years of being told what to do. They seemed a little surprised at having total freedom, but they grew into it really quickly; some of these guys now seem about four inches taller (metaphorically) than they did at the beginning of the summer."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might the definition of \"hacker\" evolve in the next twenty years according to the author?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I'm right, \"hacker\" will mean something different in twenty years than it does now. Increasingly, it will mean the people who run the company. Y Combinator is just accelerating a process that would have happened anyway. Power is shifting from the people who deal with money to the people who create technology, and if our experience this summer is any guide, this will be a good thing."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two primary methods proposed to address economic inequality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Suppose you wanted to get rid of economic inequality. There are two ways to do it: give money to the poor or take it away from the rich. But they amount to the same thing because if you want to give money to the poor, you have to get it from somewhere. You can't get it from the poor, or they just end up where they started. You have to get it from the rich."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can we effectively reduce poverty without redistributing wealth from the rich?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is, of course, a way to make the poor richer without simply shifting money from the rich. You could help the poor become more productive â for example, by improving access to education. Instead of taking money from engineers and giving it to checkout clerks, you could enable people who would have become checkout clerks to become engineers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is necessary to effectively reduce economic inequality beyond simply improving the living standards of the poor?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To effectively reduce economic inequality, it is not enough to simply raise the living standards of the poor. What if one of your newly minted engineers gets ambitious and goes on to become another Bill Gates? Economic inequality will be as bad as ever. If you actually want to compress the gap between rich and poor, you have to push down on the top as well as pushing up on the bottom."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the relationship between risk and reward affect people's willingness to take risks in betting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The problem is that risk and reward have to be proportionate. A bet with only a 10% chance of winning has to pay more than one with a 50% chance of winning, or no one will take it. So, if you lop off the top of the possible rewards, you thereby decrease people's willingness to take risks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do high tax rates impact entrepreneurial risk-taking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "High tax rates significantly impact entrepreneurial risk-taking by making certain classes of risks no longer worth pursuing if the maximum return is decreased. One reason high tax rates are disastrous is that this class of risks includes starting new companies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the main reasons why startups face high failure rates?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups are intrinsically risky. A startup is like a small boat in the open sea. One big wave and you're sunk. A competing product, a downturn in the economy, a delay in getting funding or regulatory approval, a patent suit, changing technical standards, the departure of a key employee, the loss of a big account â any one of these can destroy you overnight. It seems only about 1 in 10 startups succeeds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What return on investment did your startup achieve for its first round of outside investors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Our startup paid its first round of outside investors 36x, which meant, with current US tax rates, that it made sense to invest in us if we had better than a 1 in 24 chance of succeeding. That sounds about right. That's probably roughly how we looked when we were a couple of nerds with no business experience operating out of an apartment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What alternative sources of capital could support new companies if private funding is limited?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There might be alternative sources of capital for new companies if private funding is limited. For instance, why not have the government or some large, almost-government organization like Fannie Mae do the venture investing instead of private funds?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might it be ineffective to expect government employees to take risks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Iâll tell you why that wouldnât work: because then youâre asking government or almost-government employees to do the one thing they are least able to doâtake risks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the fundamental difference between decision-making in government bureaucracy and venture investing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As anyone who has worked for the government knows, the important thing is not to make the right choices, but to make choices that can be justified later if they fail. If there is a safe option, that's the one a bureaucrat will choose. But that is exactly the wrong way to do venture investing. The nature of the business means that you want to make terribly risky choices if the upside looks good enough."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the potential for profit influence investors' perceptions of startups led by younger entrepreneurs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The potential for profit influences investors' perceptions of startups led by younger entrepreneurs by making them focus on the upside: they get a percentage of the fund's gains. This perspective helps overcome their understandable fear of investing in a company run by individuals who look like (and perhaps are) college students."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How would the behavior of venture capitalists change if they were not allowed to profit from their investments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If VCs weren't allowed to get rich, they'd behave like bureaucrats. Without hope of gain, they'd have only fear of loss. And so they'd make the wrong choices. They'd turn down the nerds in favor of the smooth-talking MBA in a suit because that investment would be easier to justify later if it failed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are founders and early employees essential to the success of startups, regardless of changes in venture funding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But even if you could somehow redesign venture funding to work without allowing VCs to become rich, there's another kind of investor you simply cannot replace: the startup's founders and early employees."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of time and ideas in the context of investment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What they invest is their time and ideas. But these are equivalent to money; the proof is that investors are willing (if forced) to treat them as interchangeable, granting the same status to \"sweat equity\" and the equity they've purchased with cash."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the relationship between risk and reward affect decisions on where to invest time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fact that you're investing time doesn't change the relationship between risk and reward. If you're going to invest your time in something with a small chance of succeeding, you'll only do it if there is a proportionately large payoff."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated the author to pursue entrepreneurship instead of seeking employment in a stable organization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like many startup founders, I did it to get rich. But not because I wanted to buy expensive things. What I wanted was security. I wanted to make enough money that I didn't have to worry about money. If I'd been forbidden to make enough from a startup to do this, I would have sought security by some other means: for example, by going to work for a big, stable organization from which it would be hard to get fired. Instead of busting my ass in a startup, I would have tried to get a nice, low-stress job at a big research lab or tenure at a university."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What do individuals tend to do in societies where personal risk is not incentivized?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In societies where personal risk is not incentivized, individuals tend to seek security by embedding themselves in large organizations. If they cannot ensure their own safety, the next best option is to establish a stable position within a structure where their status primarily depends on the organization rather than personal risk-taking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are founders considered irreplaceable compared to investors in a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even if we could somehow replace investors, I don't see how we could replace founders. Investors mainly contribute money, which in principle is the same no matter what the source. But the founders contribute ideas. You can't replace those."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does economic inequality influence the startup ecosystem?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Economic inequality is not just a consequence of startups; it's the engine that drives them, in the same way a fall of water drives a water mill. People start startups in the hope of becoming much richer than they were before. If your society tries to prevent anyone from being much richer than anyone else, it will also prevent one person from being much richer at time t2 than at time t1."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are startups essential for the long-term sustainability of established companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "New technology and new jobs both come disproportionately from new companies. Indeed, if you don't have startups, pretty soon you won't have established companies either; just as, if you stop having kids, pretty soon you won't have any adults."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does a reduction in investors' appetite for risk impact the growth potential of promising startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, it may be that reducing investors' appetite for risk doesn't merely kill off larval startups but kills off the most promising ones especially. Startups yield faster growth at greater risk than established companies. Does this trend also hold among startups? That is, are the riskiest startups the ones that generate the most growth if they succeed? I suspect the answer is yes. And that's a chilling thought because it means that if you cut investors' appetite for risk, the most beneficial startups are the first to go."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Could taxing surplus wealth while allowing wealth accumulation through startups help reduce economic inequality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not all rich people got that way from startups, of course. What if we let people get rich by starting startups but taxed away all other surplus wealth? Wouldn't that at least decrease inequality?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the relationship between wealth and power evolved over the past century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We don't need to prevent people from being rich if we can prevent wealth from translating into power. And there has been progress on that front. Before he died of drink in 1925, Commodore Vanderbilt's wastrel grandson Reggie ran down pedestrians on five separate occasions, killing two of them. By 1969, when Ted Kennedy drove off the bridge at Chappaquiddick, the limit seemed to be down to one. Today it may well be zero. But what's changed is not variation in wealth. What's changed is the ability to translate wealth into power."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does a computer security expert consider the most crucial measure for preventing unauthorized access?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A friend of mine who knows a lot about computer security says the single most important step is to log everything. Back when he was a kid trying to break into computers, what worried him most was the idea of leaving a trail. He was more inconvenienced by the need to avoid that than by any obstacle deliberately put in his path."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy can be implemented to reduce the secret connection between wealth and power without harming the economy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like all illicit connections, the connection between wealth and power flourishes in secret. Exposing all transactions will greatly reduce it. Log everything. That's a strategy that already seems to be working, and it doesn't have the side effect of making your whole country poor."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a more effective approach to achieving a fairer world than directly targeting wealth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you try to attack wealth, you end up nailing risk as well, and with it, growth. If we want a fairer world, I think we're better off attacking one step downstream, where wealth turns into power."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What metrics do investors use to define success for startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Success here is defined from the initial investors' point of view: either an IPO or an acquisition for more than the valuation at the last round of funding. The conventional 1 in 10 success rate is suspiciously neat, but conversations with VCs suggest it's roughly correct for startups overall. Top VC firms expect to do better."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the prevalence of systems of seniority relate to wealth variation in a non-corrupt country or organization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Conjecture: The variation in wealth in a non-corrupt country or organization will be inversely proportional to the prevalence of systems of seniority. If you suppress variation in wealth, seniority will become correspondingly more important. So far, I know of no counterexamples, though in very corrupt countries, you may get both simultaneously. (Thanks to Daniel Sobral for pointing this out.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the main argument for embracing risk-taking in startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What you do in a startup is compress a lifetime's worth of work into a few years. It seems as dumb to discourage that as to discourage risk-taking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who contributed feedback and insights for the essay on venture investing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would like to thank Chris Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Dan Giffin, Jessica Livingston, and Evan Williams for reading drafts of this essay, and Langley Steinert, Sangam Pant, and Mike Moritz for providing information about venture investing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the approach to career progression and job security changed for the current generation compared to thirty years ago?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thirty years ago, one was supposed to work one's way up the corporate ladder. That's less the rule now. Our generation wants to get paid up front. Instead of developing a product for some big company in the expectation of getting job security in return, we develop the product ourselves, in a startup, and sell it to the big company. At the very least, we want options."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do economic statistics fail to accurately represent wealth disparities in socialist countries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Economic statistics are misleading because they ignore the value of safe jobs. An easy job from which one can't be fired is worth money; exchanging the two is one of the commonest forms of corruption. A sinecure is, in effect, an annuity. Except sinecures don't appear in economic statistics. If they did, it would be clear that in practice socialist countries have nontrivial disparities of wealth, because they usually have a class of powerful bureaucrats who are paid mostly by seniority and can never be fired."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the value of a position on the corporate ladder in large companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While not a sinecure, a position on the corporate ladder is genuinely valuable because big companies try not to fire people and promote from within based largely on seniority. A position on the corporate ladder has a value analogous to the \"goodwill\" that is a very real element in the valuation of companies. It means one can expect future high-paying jobs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contributed to the success of corporate raiders in the 1980s?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The corporate ladder was one of the reasons the early corporate raiders were so successful. It's not only economic statistics that ignore the value of safe jobs; corporate balance sheets do too. One reason it was profitable to carve up 1980s companies and sell them for parts was that they hadn't formally acknowledged their implicit debt to employees who had done good work and expected to be rewarded with high-paying executive jobs when their time came."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criticism does Gordon Gekko have regarding the management structure of the company, and what alternative perspective might explain the presence of numerous vice presidents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gordon Gekko ridicules a company overloaded with vice presidents. However, the company may not be as corrupt as it seems; those VPs' cushy jobs were probably payment for work done earlier."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the drawbacks of the old job promotion system compared to the new model?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The old job promotion system has several drawbacks compared to the new model. For one thing, it seems like a bad plan to treat jobs as rewards. Plenty of good engineers were made into bad managers that way. Additionally, the old system meant people had to deal with a lot more corporate politics in order to protect the work they'd invested in a position on the ladder."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the rise of open source impacted companies' use of Windows servers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lately, companies have been paying more attention to open source.

Ultimately, these will affect a lot more than what software you use."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do blogging and open source projects ensure quality and compete with professional efforts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like open source, blogging is something people do themselves, for free, because they enjoy it. Like open source hackers, bloggers compete with people working for money and often win. The method of ensuring quality is also the same: Darwinian. Companies ensure quality through rules to prevent employees from screwing up. But you don't need that when the audience can communicate with one another. People just produce whatever they want; the good stuff spreads, and the bad gets ignored. And in both cases, feedback from the audience improves the best work."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What parallels can be drawn between societal views on work and diet as societies become wealthier?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As societies get richer, they learn something about work that's a lot like what they learn about diet. We know now that the healthiest diet is the one our peasant ancestors were forced to eat because they were poor. Like rich food, idleness only seems desirable when you don't get enough of it. I think we were designed to work, just as we were designed to eat a certain amount of fiber, and we feel bad if we don't."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the historical connotation of the term \"amateur\" and how has its perception changed over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The term \"amateur\" refers to people who work for the love of it. The word now has such bad connotations that we forget its etymology, though it's staring us in the face. \"Amateur\" was originally rather a complimentary word. However, the thing to be in the twentieth century was professional, which amateurs, by definition, are not."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key insight from the open source movement regarding motivation in the workplace?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A key insight from the open source movement regarding motivation in the workplace is that people working for love often surpass those working for money.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the concept of professionalism and its historical significance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I suspect professionalism was always overratedânot just in the literal sense of working for money, but also in connotations like formality and detachment. Inconceivable as it would have seemed in, say, 1970, I think professionalism was largely a fashion, driven by conditions that happened to exist in the twentieth century."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the perception of superiority between professional journalists and amateur commentators?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The narrowness of such channels made professionals seem superior to amateurs. There were only a few jobs as professional journalists, for example, so competition ensured the average journalist was fairly good. In contrast, anyone can express opinions about current events in a bar. As a result, the average person expressing his opinions in a bar sounds like an idiot compared to a journalist writing about the subject."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the perception that blogs may not pose a significant threat to traditional media?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "On the web, the barrier for publishing your ideas is even lower. You don't have to buy a drink, and they even let kids in. Millions of people are publishing online, and the average level of what they're writing, as you might expect, is not very good. This has led some in the media to conclude that blogs don't present much of a threatâthat blogs are just a fad."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What issue arises from the print media's use of the term \"blogger\" to describe online publishers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Actually, the fad is the word \"blog,\" at least the way the print media now use it. What they mean by \"blogger\" is not someone who publishes in a weblog format, but anyone who publishes online. That's going to become a problem as the Web becomes the default medium for publication. So I'd like to suggest an alternative word for someone who publishes online. How about \"writer?\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are traditional print media competing against in the digital age?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the old world of channels, it meant something to talk about average quality because that's what you were getting, whether you liked it or not. But now you can read any writer you want. So the average quality of writing online isn't what the print media are competing against. They're competing against the best writing online. And, like Microsoft, they're losing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happens to professionals who rely on an oligopoly in their industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When professionals rely on an oligopoly in their industry, they often sink into bad habits that are hard to overcome when competition arises. As in software, when professionals produce subpar work, it's not surprising if amateurs can do better. Live by the channel, die by the channel: dependence on an oligopoly can lead to complacency and a decline in quality."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some characteristics of the work environment in a startup compared to a traditional office?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Things are different in a startup. Often, a startup begins in an apartment. Instead of matching beige cubicles, they have an assortment of furniture they bought used. They work odd hours, wearing the most casual of clothing. They look at whatever they want online without worrying whether it's \"work safe.\" The cheery, bland language of the office is replaced by wicked humor. And you know what? The company at this stage is probably the most productive it's ever going to be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key drawback of traditional office work hours according to the author?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To me, the most demoralizing aspect of the traditional office is that you're supposed to be there at certain times. There are usually a few people in a company who really have to, but the reason most employees work fixed hours is that the company can't measure their productivity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of measuring work output on traditional work schedules?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you could measure how much work people did, many companies wouldn't need any fixed workday. You could just say: this is what you have to do. Do it whenever you like, wherever you like. If your work requires you to talk to other people in the company, then you may need to be here a certain amount; otherwise, we don't care."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the company's approach to work hours and employee productivity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Our company's approach to work hours is quite flexible; there are no fixed office hours. Personally, I never showed up before 11 in the morning. However, this flexibility is not about being benevolent. We communicate to our employees that we expect them to be productive and get a lot done. It's important to us that they don't try to mislead us by simply being present for long hours without delivering results."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the negative impacts of the facetime model on productivity in large organizations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The problem with the facetime model is not just that it's demoralizing, but that the people pretending to work interrupt the ones actually working. I'm convinced the facetime model is the main reason large organizations have so many meetings. Per capita, large organizations accomplish very little. And yet all those people have to be on site at least eight hours a day. When so much time goes in one end and so little achievement comes out the other, something has to give. And meetings are the main mechanism for taking up the slack."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What emotions or thoughts did the author experience during meetings at their nine to five job?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For one year, I worked at a regular nine to five job, and I remember well the strange, cozy feeling that comes over one during meetings. I was very aware, because of the novelty, that I was being paid for programming. It seemed just amazing, as if there was a machine on my desk that spat out a dollar bill every two minutes no matter what I did, even while I was in the bathroom! But because the imaginary machine was always running, I felt I always ought to be working. And so meetings felt wonderfully relaxing. They counted as work, just like programming, but they were so much easier. All you had to do was sit and look attentive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the hidden costs of frequent meetings and email communication in the workplace?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Meetings are like an opiate with a network effect. So is email, on a smaller scale. In addition to the direct cost in time, there's the cost of fragmentationâbreaking people's days up into bits too small to be useful."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What experiment could companies conduct to assess their employees' reliance on communication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can see how dependent you've become on something by removing it suddenly. So for big companies, I propose the following experiment: set aside one day where meetings are forbiddenâwhere everyone has to sit at their desk all day and work without interruption on things they can do without talking to anyone else. Some amount of communication is necessary in most jobs, but I'm sure many employees could find eight hours' worth of stuff they could do by themselves. You could call it \"Work Day.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might someone feel guilty about engaging in reflective thinking during work hours?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other problem with pretend work is that it often looks better than real work. When I'm writing or hacking, I spend as much time just thinking as I do actually typing. Half the time I'm sitting, drinking a cup of tea, or walking around the neighborhood. This is a critical phaseâthis is where ideas come fromâand yet I'd feel guilty doing this in most offices, with everyone else looking busy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are open source projects and blogging valuable for understanding the quality of work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's hard to see how bad some practices are until you have something to compare them to. And that's one reason open source, and even blogging in some cases, is so important. They show us what real work looks like."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are the new startups expected to work from their apartments instead of traditional office spaces?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We're funding eight new startups at the moment. A friend asked what they were doing for office space and seemed surprised when I said we expected them to work out of whatever apartments they found to live in. But we didn't propose that to save money. We did it because we want their software to be good. Working in informal spaces is one of the things startups do right without realizing it. As soon as you get into an office, work and life start to drift apart."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do open source and blogging demonstrate the value of grassroots innovation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The third big lesson we can learn from open source and blogging is that ideas can bubble up from the bottom instead of flowing down from the top. Open source and blogging both work bottom-up: people make what they want, and the best stuff prevails."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two main forces that influence design in the channel era?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two forces that together steer design: ideas about what to do next and the enforcement of quality. In the channel era, both flowed down from the top. For example, newspaper editors assigned stories to reporters and then edited what they wrote."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do open source and blogging challenge traditional notions of quality and idea enforcement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Open source and blogging show us that things don't have to work that way. Ideas and even the enforcement of quality can flow bottom-up. In both cases, the results are not merely acceptable but better. For example, open source software is more reliable precisely because it's open source; anyone can find mistakes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What concerns does the author express about publishing essays with limited online visibility?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That hadn't been online. Once an essay has had a couple thousand page views, I feel reasonably confident about it. But these had had literally orders of magnitude less scrutiny. It felt like releasing software without testing it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the transition to online publishing changed perceptions of traditional manuscript review processes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The transition to online publishing has significantly altered perceptions of traditional manuscript review processes. In the past, if you managed to get ten people to read a manuscript, you considered yourself lucky. However, having become accustomed to online publishing, the old method now seems alarmingly unreliable, akin to navigating by dead reckoning after becoming used to GPS."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did the author prefer the idea of their work being rejected by the magazine editor?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That seemed suitable for a magazine, so I sent it to an editor I know. As I was waiting to hear back, I found to my surprise that I was hoping they'd reject it. Then I could put it online right away. If they accepted it, it wouldn't be read by anyone for months, and in the meantime, I'd have to fight word by word to save it from being mangled by some twenty-five-year-old copy editor."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some common barriers that innovative employees face when trying to implement their ideas within a company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Innovative employees often face significant barriers when trying to implement their ideas within a company. They are eager to build great things for the companies they work for, but more often than not, management won't let them. How many of us have heard stories of employees going to management and saying, \"Please let us build this thing to make money for you,\" only to be met with a \"no\"? The most famous example is probably Steve Wozniak, who originally wanted to build microcomputers for his then-employer, HP, but they turned him down. On the blunderometer, this episode ranks with IBM accepting a non-exclusive license for DOS. I believe this happens all the time; we just don't hear about it usually because, to prove oneself right, one often has to quit and start their own company, like Wozniak did."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key lessons that open source and blogging can teach businesses about productivity and management?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So these, I think, are the three big lessons open source and blogging have to teach businesses: (1) that people work harder on stuff they like, (2) that the standard office environment is very unproductive, and (3) that bottom-up often works better than top-down."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might the traditional employer-employee relationship evolve in a future influenced by open source and blogging principles?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So what will business look like when it has assimilated the lessons of open source and blogging? I think the big obstacle preventing us from seeing the future of business is the assumption that people working for you have to be employees. But think about what's going on underneath: the company has some money, and they pay it to the employee in the hope that he'll make something worth more than they paid him. Well, there are other ways to arrange that relationship. Instead of paying the guy money as a salary, why not give it to him as investment? Then, instead of coming to your office to work on your projects, he can work wherever he wants on projects of his own."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the challenges and frustrations associated with customer service and management roles?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I dislike being on either end of it. I'll work my ass off for a customer, but I resent being told what to do by a boss. Being a boss is also horribly frustrating; half the time it's easier just to do stuff yourself than to get someone else to do it for you. I'd rather do almost anything than give or receive a performance review."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is employment considered a unique economic relationship compared to other business transactions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nothing shows more clearly that employment is not an ordinary economic relationship than companies being sued for firing people. In any purely economic relationship, you're free to do what you want. If you want to stop buying steel pipe from one supplier and start buying it from another, you don't have to explain why. No one can accuse you of wrongdoing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the dissatisfaction of employees in a seemingly secure and well-compensated job environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Next time you're in a moderately large city, drop by the main post office and watch the body language of the people working there. They have the same sullen resentment as children made to do something they don't want to. Their union has exacted pay increases and work restrictions that would have been the envy of previous generations of postal workers, and yet they don't seem any happier for it. It's demoralizing to be on the receiving end of a paternalistic relationship, no matter how cozy the terms. Just ask any teenager."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What emotional challenges do entrepreneurs face when dealing with the problems their startups aim to solve?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The thought of our startups keeps me up at night. All the pain of whatever problem you're trying to solve is still there. But the pain hurts less when it isn't mixed with resentment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact did working at Yahoo after its acquisition of the startup have on your behavior and work experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I had the misfortune to participate in what amounted to a controlled experiment to prove that. After Yahoo bought our startup, I went to work for them. I was doing exactly the same work, except with bosses. To my horror, I started acting like a child. The situation pushed buttons I'd forgotten I had."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key benefit of pursuing investment opportunities instead of traditional employment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The big advantage of investment over employment, as the examples of open source and blogging suggest, is that people working on projects of their own are enormously more productive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Google foster a creative and engaging work environment for its employees?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Google is a rare example of a big company in tune with the forces I've described. They've tried hard to make their offices less sterile than the usual cube farm. They give employees who do great work large grants of stock to simulate the rewards of a startup. They even let hackers spend 20% of their time on their own projects."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the potential for more individuals to pursue entrepreneurship after leaving school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So am I claiming that no one is going to be an employee anymoreâthat everyone should go and start a startup? Of course not. But more people could do it than do it now. At the moment, even the smartest students leave school thinking they have to get a job."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a more advantageous path for ambitious individuals seeking to create value?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Actually, what they need to do is make something valuable. A job is one way to do that, but the more ambitious ones will ordinarily be better off taking money from an investor than an employer."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the most challenging aspect of developing a successful product?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first phase of that is mostly product creationâthat is, hacking. That's the hard part. It's a lot harder to create something people love than to take something people love and figure out how to make money from it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors might influence a person's decision to start a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another factor that keeps people away from starting startups is the risk. Someone with kids and a mortgage should think twice before doing it. However, most young hackers have neither."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of pursuing independent projects compared to traditional employment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pursuing independent projects, as the examples of open source and blogging suggest, can be more enjoyable, even if you fail. You'll be working on your own thing instead of going to an office and doing what you're told. There may be more pain in your own company, but it won't hurt as much."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How is the relationship between employers and employees evolving due to open source and blogging?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The greatest effect, in the long run, of the forces underlying open source and blogging may be the final ditching of the old paternalistic employer-employee relationship, replacing it with a purely economic one between equals."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What misconception about changing an operating system was highlighted in a Forrester Research survey?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A survey by Forrester Research, reported in the cover story of Business Week on January 31, 2005, highlighted a misconception that one must replace the actual server in order to switch the operating system."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What happened to the article I submitted after a delay in sending the final version?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They accepted the article, but I took so long to send them the final version that, by the time I did, the section of the magazine they'd accepted it for had disappeared in a reorganization."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do PR firms play in shaping the news stories we encounter in traditional media?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most surprising things I discovered during my brief business career was the existence of the PR industry, lurking like a huge, quiet submarine beneath the news. Of the stories you read in traditional media that aren't about politics, crimes, or disasters, more than half probably come from PR firms."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did you decide to allocate your startup's entire marketing budget to PR instead of traditional advertising?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I know because I spent years hunting such \"press hits.\" Our startup spent its entire marketing budget on PR; at a time when we were assembling our own computers to save money, we were paying a PR firm $16,000 a month. And they were worth it. PR is the news equivalent of search engine optimization; instead of buying ads, which readers ignore, you get yourself inserted directly into the stories."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the author's impression of the PR agency they recommended to a startup founder in 1997?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In 1997, I got a call from another startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company. I told him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous fees. And we weren't the only ones they did great things for. But I remember thinking his company's name was odd. Why call an auction site \"eBay\"?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do the best PR firms prioritize honesty and valuable information in their communications with reporters?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "PR is not dishonest. Not quite. In fact, the reason the best PR firms are so effective is precisely that they aren't dishonest. They give reporters genuinely valuable information. A good PR firm won't bug reporters just because the client tells them to; they've worked hard to build their credibility with reporters, and they don't want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do effective flatterers and successful PR firms manipulate perceptions without resorting to falsehoods?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A good flatterer doesn't lie but tells his victim selective truths (e.g., \"What a nice color your eyes are\"). Good PR firms use the same strategy: they give reporters stories that are true, but whose truth favors their clients."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influenced the media coverage of small merchants competing with larger companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, our PR firm often pitched stories about how the Web let small merchants compete with big ones. This was perfectly true. However, the reason reporters ended up writing stories about this particular truth, rather than some other one, was that small merchants were our target market, and we were paying the piper."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the main reason top reporters may not respond well to story pitches?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The weak point of top reporters is not laziness, but vanity. You don't pitch stories to them; you have to approach them as if you were a specimen under their all-seeing microscope and make it seem as if the story you want them to run is something they thought of themselves."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy did the team use to position themselves as a significant player in the online store market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Our greatest PR coup was a two-part one. We estimated, based on some fairly informal math, that there were about 5,000 stores on the Web. We got one paper to print this number, which seemed neutral enough. But once this \"fact\" was out there in print, we could quote it to other publications and claim that with 1,000 users, we had 20% of the online store market."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do media reports often misrepresent the sources of information regarding criminal cases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reporters like definitive statements. For example, many of the stories about Jeremy Jaynes's conviction say that he was one of the 10 worst spammers. This \"fact\" originated in Spamhaus's ROKSO list, which I think even Spamhaus would admit is a rough guess at the top spammers. The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but now it's simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do PR firms craft messages to meet the demands of reporters?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "PR firms craft messages to meet the demands of reporters by providing statements that are clear and impactful. Reporters prefer concise and compelling phrases over vague descriptions. For example, instead of saying someone is a \"fairly big spammer,\" they would rather have a definitive statement like \"top ten.\" PR firms understand this need and tailor their messages accordingly to ensure they resonate with the media."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do PR firms create the illusion of trends in media coverage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Where the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is in the generation of \"buzz.\" They usually feed the same story to several different publications at once. When readers see similar stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend afoot, which is exactly what they're supposed to think."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did public relations impact the launch success of Windows 95?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When Windows 95 was launched, people waited outside stores at midnight to buy the first copies. None of them would have been there without PR firms, which generated such a buzz in the news media that it became self-reinforcing, like a nuclear chain reaction."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can one identify the influence of PR firms in trend articles?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Trend articles like this are almost always the work of PR firms. Once you know how to read them, it's straightforward to figure out who the client is. With trend stories, PR firms usually line up one or more \"experts\" to talk about the industry generally. In this case, we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact did The Men's Wearhouse's advertising campaign have on media coverage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not surprisingly, considering The Men's Wearhouse was at that moment running ads saying, \"The Suit is Back,\" this led to a successful press hitâa wire service article whose first sentence is your own ad copy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can you track down additional press coverage related to a specific PR pitch?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The secret to finding other press hits from a given pitch is to realize that they all started from the same document back at the PR firm. Search for a few key phrases and the names of the clients and the experts, and you'll turn up other variants of this story."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the proposed term for the phenomenon of identifying patterns in trend stories promoted by PR firms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now that so many news articles are online, I suspect you could find a similar pattern for most trend stories placed by PR firms. I propose we call this new sport \"PR diving,\" and I'm sure there are far more striking examples out there than this clump of five stories."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What insights did you gain about press hits and media articles after hiring a PR firm?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "After spending years chasing them, it's now second nature for me to recognize press hits for what they are. But before we hired a PR firm, I had no idea where articles in the mainstream media came from. I could tell a lot of them were not credible, but I didn't realize why."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What additional question should critical readers ask beyond evaluating the author's truthfulness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Remember the exercises in critical reading you did in school, where you had to look at a piece of writing and step back and ask whether the author was telling the whole truth? If you really want to be a critical reader, it turns out you have to step back one step further and ask not just whether the author is telling the truth, but also what perspectives or biases might be influencing their narrative."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do readers tend to trust bloggers more than traditional print publications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Online, the answer tends to be a lot simpler. Most people who publish online write what they write for the simple reason that they want to. You can't see the fingerprints of PR firms all over the articles, as you can in so many print publicationsâwhich is one of the reasons, though they may not consciously realize it, that readers trust bloggers more than traditional print publications."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does a newspaper employee believe about the current state of print media?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I was talking recently to a friend who works for a big newspaper. He thought the print media were in serious trouble and that they were still mostly in denial about it. \"They think the decline is cyclic,\" he said. \"Actually, it's structural.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the value of online writing compared to traditional media?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whatever its flaws, the writing you find online is authentic. It's not mystery meat cooked up out of scraps of pitch letters and press releases, and pressed into molds of zippy journalese. It's people writing what they think."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has your perspective on writing for publication changed in recent years?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I used to think of writing for publication as merely a means of conveying information. However, I didn't realize until the last few years that writing for publication didn't have to mean writing that way. I discovered that you could write as candidly and informally as you would if you were writing to a friend."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do PR firms face in adapting to the rise of blogs and online media?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "PR professionals fear bloggers for the same reason readers like them. This indicates that there may be a struggle ahead. As this new kind of writing draws readers away from traditional media, we should be prepared for whatever PR mutates into to compensate. When I think about how hard PR firms work to score press hits in traditional media, I can't imagine they'll work any less hard to feed stories to bloggers, if they can figure out how."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do advertisers pay less for ads in free publications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Advertisers pay less for ads in free publications because they assume readers ignore something they get for free. This is why so many trade publications nominally have a cover price and yet give away free subscriptions with such abandon."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the estimated number of computers infected by the Internet worm of 1988, and how was this estimate derived?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most striking example I know of this type is the \"fact\" that the Internet worm of 1988 infected 6,000 computers. I was there when it was cooked up, and this was the recipe: someone guessed that there were about 60,000 computers attached to the Internet, and that the worm might have infected ten percent of them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are some research groups at prestigious institutions like MIT choosing to switch to Macs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some research groups at prestigious institutions like MIT are gradually switching to Macs. My friend Robert said his whole research group at MIT recently bought themselves PowerBooks. These guys are not the graphic designers and grandmas who were buying Macs at Apple's low point in the mid-1990s. They're about as hardcore OS hackers as you can get."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the perception of the Mac computer among hackers in the mid-90s?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For most of us, it's not a switch to Apple, but a return.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the impact of the introduction of the Macintosh computer on students' perceptions of computing technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the fall of 1983, the professor in one of my college CS classes got up and announced, like a prophet, that there would soon be a computer with half a MIPS of processing power that would fit under an airline seat and cost so little that we could save enough to buy one from a summer job. The whole room gasped. And when the Mac appeared, it was even better than we'd hoped. It was small and powerful and cheap, as promised. But it was also something we'd never considered a computer could be: fabulously well-designed and user-friendly."}]}

Maybe, I suggested, he should buy some stock in this company. I think he really wishes he'd listened."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the financial incentives and operational challenges faced by venture capitalists when managing large funds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like the managers of mutual funds or hedge funds, VCs get paid a percentage of the money they manage: about 2% a year in management fees, plus a percentage of the gains. So they want the fund to be hugeâhundreds of millions of dollars, if possible. But that means each partner ends up being responsible for investing a lot of money. And since one person can only manage so many deals, each deal has to be for multiple millions of dollars."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists take a long time in their decision-making process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Venture capitalists take a long time to make decisions because they conduct extensive due diligence, which can feel as invasive as a body cavity search. With so much at stake, they have to be paranoid."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists often steal ideas from founders?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It explains why they steal your ideas. Every founder knows that VCs will tell your secrets to your competitors if they end up investing in them. It's not unheard of for VCs to meet you when they have no intention of funding you, just to pick your brain for a competitor. This prospect makes naive founders clumsily secretive. Experienced founders treat it as a cost of doing business. Either way, it sucks. But again, the only reason VCs are so sneaky is the giant deals they do. With so much at stake, they have to be devious."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do venture capitalists often take an active role in the management of the companies they invest in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Venture capitalists often take an active role in the management of the companies they invest in because they want to be on the board not just to advise, but also to monitor the company's progress. They may even install a new CEO who, while having extensive business experience, is also closely aligned with their interests. These newly installed CEOs often play something of the role of a political commissar in a Red Army unit. With so much at stake, VCs can't resist micromanaging the companies they invest in."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential downsides of large venture capital investments for startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The huge investments themselves are something founders would dislike if they realized how damaging they can be. VCs don't invest $x million because that's the amount you need, but because that's the amount the structure of their business requires them to invest. Like steroids, these sudden huge investments can do more harm than good. Google survived enormous VC funding because it could legitimately absorb large amounts of money; they had to buy a lot of servers and a lot of bandwidth to crawl the whole Web. Less fortunate startups just end up hiring armies of people to sit around having meetings."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of high valuations for founders in a startup?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "High valuations often result from significant investments, which are necessary to keep founders engaged. While many founders may perceive a high valuation as a positive development, it's important to remember that a high valuation is not inherently beneficial. You cannot \"eat\" paper; the true value of a high valuation can only be realized if the founders can achieve the necessary business milestones to capitalize on it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do founders face when trying to achieve a liquidity event after raising venture capital?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Founders face significant challenges when trying to achieve a liquidity event after raising venture capital. One major issue is that the higher the company's valuation, the narrower the options become for executing a liquidity event. Many founders might be willing to sell their company for $15 million, but venture capitalists who have just invested at a pre-money valuation of $8 million are unlikely to accept that. This situation puts founders in a difficult position, as they are essentially rolling the dice again, whether they like it or not."}]}

This was, at the time, more than the valuation of our entire company. Was I worried? Not at all: I was delighted. It was like watching a car you're chasing turn down a street that you know has no outlet."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why didn't the investors consider buying the company for $20 million?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Their smartest move at that point would have been to take every penny of the $20 million and use it to buy us. We would have sold. Their investors would have been furious, of course. But I think the main reason they never considered this was that they never imagined we could be had so cheap. They probably assumed we were on the same VC gravy train they were."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did limited spending impact a company's ability to sell itself compared to its competitors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, we only spent about $2 million in our entire existence, and that gave us flexibility. We could sell ourselves to Yahoo for $50 million, and everyone was delighted. If our competitor had done that, the last round of investors would presumably have lost money. I assume they could have vetoed such a deal. But no one those days was paying a lot more than Yahoo. So unless their founders could pull off an IPO (which would be difficult with Yahoo as a competitor), they had no choice but to ride the thing down."}]}

Instead, they can choose those rare companies, like Google, that will actually benefit from the giant sums they're compelled to invest."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common criticism VCs have about the current funding landscape?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "VCs often complain that in their business, there's too much money chasing too few deals.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What analogy is used to describe the experience of undergoing due diligence by venture capitalists?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Due diligence tends to be like a body cavity search by someone with a faulty knowledge of human anatomy.

People are always asking you this, so you think you're supposed to have an answer. But adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter.

You don't need to be in a rush to choose your life's work. What you need to do is discover what you like. You have to work on stuff you like if you want to be good at what you do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it difficult for individuals to determine their true career interests?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what you like, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it's difficult to get an accurate picture of most jobs.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do rapidly changing job markets present for career planning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The challenges presented by rapidly changing job markets for career planning include the emergence of jobs that do not yet exist. Most of the work I've done in the last ten years didn't exist when I was in high school. The world changes fast, and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up. In such a world, it's not a good idea to have fixed plans."}]}

I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it because it implies you're supposed to be bound by some plan you made early on. The computer world has a name for this: premature optimization. It is synonymous with disaster. These speakers would do better to say simply, don't give up."}]}

Don't think that you can't do what other people can. And I agree you shouldn't underestimate your potential. People who've done great things tend to seem as if they were a race apart. Most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius. In fact, I suspect if you had the sixteen-year-old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological reasoning do people often use to explain the achievements of geniuses?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these individuals were able to achieve what they did only because of some magic \"Shakespeareness\" or \"Einsteinness,\" then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good."}]}

If you major in math, it will be easy to get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics, it will be hard to get into grad school in math."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What metaphor can be used to illustrate the importance of maintaining a favorable position in pursuing goals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule, you want to stay upwind. So I propose that as a replacement for \"don't give up on your dreams\": stay upwind."}]}

The professors all seem forbiddingly intellectual and publish papers unintelligible to outsiders. However, while in some fields the papers are unintelligible because they're full of hard ideas, in others they're deliberately written in an obscure way to seem as if they're saying something important.

While it may seem grim to suggest that we should worry, it's not as bad as it sounds. In fact, it's exhilarating to overcome those worries.

I don't mean that I'd slack in school. Working at something as a day job doesn't mean doing it badly; it means not being defined by it.

Choose a project that will take less than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish. Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially at first. If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another. Repeat till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one. (This could take years.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of keeping a project secret and involving a select group of friends?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It may be just as well not to do a project \"for school,\" if that will restrict you or make it seem like work. Involve your friends if you want, but not too many, and only if they're not flakes. Friends offer moral support (few startups are started by one person), but secrecy also has its advantages. There's something pleasing about a secret project. And you can take more risks because no one will know if you fail."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How should one approach a project that doesn't initially align with their goals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't worry if a project doesn't seem to be on the path to some goal you're supposed to have. Paths can bend a lot more than you think. So let the path grow out of the project. The most important thing is to be excited about it, because it's by doing that you learn."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some unseemly motivations that can drive individuals to pursue ambitious goals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Don't disregard unseemly motivations. One of the most powerful is the desire to be better than other people at something. Hardy said that's what got him started, and I think the only unusual thing about him is that he admitted it. Another powerful motivator is the desire to do or know things you're not supposed to. Closely related is the desire to do something audacious. Sixteen-year-olds aren't supposed to write novels. So if you try, anything you achieve is on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you're doing no worse than expectations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What warning does the author give about the influence of admired writing styles on one's own creativity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Beware of bad models, especially when they excuse laziness. When I was in high school, I used to write \"existentialist\" short stories like ones I'd seen by famous writers. My stories didn't have a lot of plot, but they were very deep. And they were less work to write than entertaining ones would have been. I should have known that was a danger sign. In fact, I found my stories pretty boring; what excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff like the famous writers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the author come to about the relationship between fame and the quality of work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now I have enough experience to realize that those famous writers actually sucked. Plenty of famous people do; in the short term, the quality of one's work is only a small component of fame. I should have been less worried about doing something that seemed cool and just done something I liked. That's the actual road to coolness anyway."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an essential step in undertaking a project that involves learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is to find good books. Most books are bad. Nearly all textbooks are bad. So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever book on it happens to be closest. You have to search actively for the tiny number of good books."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can individuals take charge of their lives regardless of age or external validation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers; it could be shaped by your own curiosity. It is for all ambitious adults, and you don't have to wait to start. In fact, you don't have to wait to be an adult. There's no switch inside you that magically flips when you turn a certain age or graduate from some institution. You start being an adult when you decide to take responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do both minors and adults face in their daily lives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This may sound like nonsense. I'm just a minor, you may think; I have no money, I have to live at home, and I have to do what adults tell me all day long. Well, most adults labor under restrictions just as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done. If you think it's restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What key realization distinguishes adults from high school students, according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The only real difference between adults and high school kids is that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school kids don't. That realization hits most people around 23. But I'm letting you in on the secret early. So get to work. Maybe you can be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't how much time you wasted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What experiment can you conduct to assess your dependence on distractions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To measure how dependent you've become on distractions, try this experiment: set aside a chunk of time on a weekend and sit alone to think. You can have a notebook to write your thoughts down in, but nothing else: no friends, TV, music, phone, IM, email, web, games, books, newspapers, or magazines. Within an hour, most people will feel a strong craving for distraction."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What would happen to parents' decisions about sending their children to prep schools if those schools negatively impacted college admissions but still offered a high-quality education?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The question of parents' decisions about sending their children to prep schools becomes intriguing when considering the impact on college admissions. Suppose prep schools provided the same superior education but had a tiny (0.001) negative effect on college admissions. How many parents would still choose to send their kids to them? While these schools generally offer a better education, the potential negative effect on college admissions could significantly influence parents' choices."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the educational background of public school students impact their performance in college compared to their private school peers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The educational background of public school students impacts their performance in college compared to their private school peers. While some may argue that private school students are better college candidates, this seems empirically false. What you learn in even the best high school is rounding error compared to what you learn in college. Public school students arrive at college with a slight disadvantage, but they start to pull ahead in their sophomore year."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the lack of accountability and competition in high school education?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are simply no outside forces pushing high schools to be good. The air traffic control system works because planes would crash otherwise. Businesses have to deliver because otherwise competitors would take their customers. But no planes crash if your school is inadequate, and it has no competitors. High school isn't evil; it's random; but random is pretty bad."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What did Samuel Johnson imply about the motivations behind writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Samuel Johnson implied that the motivations behind writing are often financial, stating, \"No man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money.\" While many hope he was exaggerating, it suggests that a significant number of great works were created primarily to make money."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What might happen if adults were placed in a high school environment and subjected to its rules?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I wonder if they'd like it if you did. You may be loud and disorganized, but you're very docile compared to adults. If you actually started acting like adults, it would be just as if a bunch of adults had been transposed into your bodies. Imagine the reaction of an FBI agent, taxi driver, or reporter to being told they had to ask permission to go to the bathroom, and only one person could go at a time. To say nothing of the things you're taught. If a bunch of actual adults suddenly found themselves trapped in high school, the first thing they'd do is form a union and renegotiate all the rules with the administration."}]}

She arrived looking astonished. \"It's so beautiful!\" she exclaimed, clearly impressed by the scenery along the way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do travel depictions of America often contrast with the realities of its urban environments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People from other rich countries can scarcely imagine the squalor of the man-made bits of America. In travel books, they show you mostly natural environments: the Grand Canyon, whitewater rafting, and horses in a field. If you see pictures with man-made things in them, it will be either a view of the New York skyline shot from a discreet distance or a carefully cropped image of a seacoast town in Maine."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "In which fields does the author suggest that a non-systematic approach is more effective?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This works well in some fields and badly in others. I suspect it works in movies and software because they're both messy processes. \"Systematic\" is the last word I'd use to describe the way these fields operate."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do software developers approach the coding process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Software developers approach the coding process by writing software. Code is not something they assemble painstakingly after careful planning, like the pyramids. It's something they plunge into, working fast and constantly changing their minds, like a charcoal sketch."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to prioritize speed over meticulousness in software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In software development, paradoxical as it sounds, good craftsmanship means working fast. If you work slowly and meticulously, you merely end up with a very fine implementation of your initial, mistaken idea. Working slowly and meticulously is premature optimization. It is better to get a prototype done fast and see what new ideas it gives you."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the filmmaking process compare to software development in terms of imperfections and execution?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The filmmaking process is quite similar to software development. Every movie is a Frankenstein, full of imperfections and usually quite different from what was originally envisioned. However, it is interesting and is often finished fairly quickly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to success in the car industry compared to industries like software or movies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Success in the car industry is influenced by several factors that differ from those in software or movies. Cars, like cities, are inherently physical products, which imposes more constraints on innovation. If the car business operated like software or movies, one could easily surpass competitors by creating a car that weighed only fifty pounds or folded up to the size of a motorcycle for parking convenience. However, in the automotive sector, success is less about dramatic innovations and more about good taste and attention to detail."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some Americans struggle to appreciate the concept of \"taste\" in design?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The trouble is, the very word \"taste\" sounds slightly ridiculous to American ears. It seems pretentious, frivolous, or even effeminate. Blue staters think it's \"subjective,\" and red staters think it's for sissies. So anyone in America who really cares about design will be sailing upwind."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What has shifted in the perception of the US car industry's issues over the past two decades?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Twenty years ago, we used to hear that the problem with the US car industry was the workers. We don't hear that anymore now that Japanese companies are building cars in the US. The problem with American cars is bad design. You can see that just by looking at them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the main criticism of the design process for this car compared to American cars today?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main criticism of the design process for this car, compared to American cars today, is that it was designed by marketing people instead of designers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What cultural factors contribute to the superior quality of Japanese car manufacturing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why do the Japanese make better cars than us? Some say it's because their culture encourages cooperation. That may come into it, but in this case, it seems more to the point that their culture prizes design and craftsmanship."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What values are prioritized in certain industries over design and craftsmanship?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We don't especially prize design or craftsmanship here. What we like is speed, and we're willing to do something in an ugly way to get it done fast. In some fields, like software or movies, this is a net win."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common factor influences the design quality in American software, movies, and Japanese cars?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But it's not just that software and movies are malleable mediums. In those businesses, the designers (though they're not generally called that) have more power. Software companies, at least successful ones, tend to be run by programmers. And in the film industry, though producers may second-guess directors, the director controls most of what appears on the screen. And so American software and movies, and Japanese cars, all have this in common: the people in charge care about designâthe former because the designers are in charge, and the latter because the whole culture cares about design."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are American car companies struggling to maintain market share despite their marketing strategies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "American car companies are struggling to maintain market share despite their marketing strategies because they rely on what marketing people think consumers want rather than following their own internal design compass, as Henry Ford did. This approach is not working, and American cars continue to lose market share. The reason is that customers often do not want what they think they want."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is relying on focus groups for car design considered a short-term strategy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Relying on focus groups for car design is considered a short-term strategy because letting focus groups design your cars for you only wins in the short term. In the long term, it pays to bet on good design. The focus group may say they want the meretricious feature du jour, but what they want even more is to imitate sophisticated buyers, and they, though a small minority, really do care about good design. Eventually, the pimps and drug dealers notice that the doctors and lawyers have switched from Cadillac to Lexus and do the same."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What sets Apple apart from other American companies in the consumer electronics market?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Apple is an interesting counterexample to the general American trend. If you want to buy a nice CD player, you'll probably buy a Japanese one. But if you want to buy an MP3 player, you'll probably buy an iPod. What happened? Why doesn't Sony dominate MP3 players? Because Apple is in the consumer electronics business now, and unlike other American companies, they're obsessed with good design. Or more precisely, their CEO is."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does a great designer play in exceeding unrecognized expectations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For it to surprise me, it must be satisfying expectations I didn't know I had. No focus group is going to discover those. Only a great designer can."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of the just-do-it model in wealth generation and innovation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The just-do-it model does have advantages. It seems the clear winner for generating wealth and technical innovations (which are practically the same thing). I think speed is the reason. It's hard to create wealth by making a commodity. The real value is in things that are new, and if you want to be the first to make something, it helps to work fast. For better or worse, the just-do-it model is fast, whether you're Dan Bricklin writing the prototype of VisiCalc in a weekend or a real estate developer building a block of shoddy condos in a month."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can we balance the need for individualism and innovation in technology with the creation of pleasant living environments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I had to choose between the just-do-it model and the careful model, I'd probably choose just-do-it. But do we have to choose? Could we have it both ways? Could Americans have nice places to live without undermining the impatient, individualistic spirit that makes us good at software? Could other countries introduce more individualism into their technology companies and research labs without having it metastasize as strip malls? I'm optimistic. It's harder to say about other countries, but in the US, at least, I think we can have both."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influence Japan's approach to building and city planning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Japan is prone to earthquakes, so buildings are traditionally seen as temporary; there is no grand tradition of city planning like the one Europeans inherited from Rome. The other cause is the notoriously corrupt relationship between the government and construction companies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common bias do political writers exhibit when analyzing election outcomes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People who write about politics, whether on the left or the right, have a consistent bias: they take politics seriously. When one candidate beats another, they look for political explanations. The country is shifting to the left or the right. That sort of shift can certainly be the result of a presidential election, which makes it easy to believe it was the cause."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors influenced your decision to vote for Bill Clinton over George H.W. Bush?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I think about why I voted for Clinton over the first George Bush, it wasn't because I was shifting to the left. Clinton just seemed more dynamic. He seemed to want the job more. Bush seemed old and tired. I suspect it was the same for a lot of voters."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did charisma influence the political fortunes of Al Gore compared to George Bush and Bob Dole in the 2000 election?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "He was just more charismatic than George Bush or (God help us) Bob Dole. In 2000, we practically got a controlled experiment to prove it: Gore had Clinton's policies, but not his charisma, and he suffered proportionally."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did Nixon choose not to participate in televised debates against Humphrey?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nixon knew he had less charisma than Humphrey and thus simply refused to debate him on TV.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did television influence the type of candidates in political elections, particularly in the context of Kennedy's campaign?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Undoubtedly, TV helped Kennedy, so historians are correct in regarding this election as a watershed. TV required a new kind of candidate; there would be no more Calvin Coolidges."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has charisma influenced the outcomes of presidential elections since the advent of television?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One would like to believe elections are won and lost on issues, if only fake ones like Willie Horton. And yet, if they are, we have a remarkable coincidence to explain. In every presidential election since TV became widespread, the apparently more charismatic candidate has won. Surprising, isn't it, that voters' opinions on the issues have lined up with charisma for 11 elections in a row?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factor do major parties rely on to influence election outcomes when they strategically adjust their message on key issues?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not saying that issues don't matter to voters. Of course they do. But the major parties know so well which issues matter, how much to how many voters, and adjust their message so precisely in response that they tend to split the difference on the issues, leaving the election to be decided by the one factor they can't control: charisma."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What might have changed the outcome of the 2004 election for the Democrats?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If the Democrats had been running a candidate as charismatic as Clinton in the 2004 election, he would have won. And we would be reading that the election was a referendum on the war in Iraq, instead of that the Democrats are out of touch with evangelical Christians in middle America."}]}

To a scientist, at least, that means it deserves attention, however implausible it seems."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do politicians focus on the electoral vote rather than the popular vote during elections?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Politicians focus on the electoral vote rather than the popular vote during elections because the electoral vote ultimately decides the election outcome. While it is true that Gore won the popular vote, candidates campaign for the electoral vote to secure victory. If Bush had been campaigning for the popular vote, he would presumably have received more of it. (Thanks to judgmentalist for this point.)"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the theory suggest about the electability of charismatic candidates with controversial pasts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One implication of this theory is that parties shouldn't be too quick to reject candidates with skeletons in their closets. Charismatic candidates will tend to have more skeletons than squeaky-clean dullards, but in practice, that doesn't seem to lose elections. The current Bush, for example, probably did more drugs in his twenties than any preceding president, and yet managed to get elected with a base of evangelical Christians. All you have to do is say you've reformed and stonewall about the details."}]}

This wasn't just random error; in every swing state, they overestimated the Kerry vote. In Florida, which Bush ultimately won 52-47, exit polls predicted a dead heat."}]}

They're from about midnight Eastern time, long after polls closed in Ohio and Florida. And yet, by the next afternoon, the exit poll numbers online corresponded to the returns. The only way I can imagine this happening is if those in charge of the exit polls cooked the books after seeing the actual returns. But that's another issue."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What psychological phenomenon might explain why candidates with a comfortable lead in polls can still lose an election?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What happened? The source of the problem may be a variant of the Bradley Effect. This term was invented after Tom Bradley, the Black mayor of Los Angeles, lost an election for governor of California despite a comfortable lead in the polls. Apparently, voters were afraid to say they planned to vote against him, lest their motives be (perhaps correctly) suspected."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do pollsters address non-responses when trying to achieve a random sample?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pollsters address non-responses by noting the age, race, and sex of individuals who do not respond to their questions. This is important because, to achieve a truly random sample, pollsters often select every 20th person leaving a polling place and ask who they voted for. However, not everyone is willing to answer. If pollsters simply ignore those who do not respond, their sample would no longer be random. Therefore, they make educated guesses about how non-respondents might have voted based on the demographic information they collect."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might some voters have hesitated to openly disclose their support for Bush in this election?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is often a difference between who people vote for and whether they're willing to talk about it.

So, when a stranger (for example, a pollster) asks them their opinion about something like gay marriage, they will not always say what they really think."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might exit polls underestimate the true conservativeness of ordinary voters in a liberal-leaning environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When the values of the elite are liberal, polls will tend to underestimate the conservativeness of ordinary voters. This seems to me the leading theory to explain why the exit polls were so far off this year. NPR values suggested one ought to vote for Kerry. So all the people who voted for Kerry felt virtuous for doing so and were eager to tell pollsters they had. No one who voted for Kerry did it as an act of quiet defiance."}]}

White said, \"good writing is rewriting.\" I didn't realize this when I was in school. In writing, as in math and science, they only show you the finished product. You don't see all the false starts. This gives students a misleading view of how things get made."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might writers be hesitant to share early drafts of their work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Part of the reason it happens is that writers don't want people to see their mistakes. However, I'm willing to let people see an early draft if it will show how much you have to rewrite to shape an essay into its final form."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some categories of cuts identified in the writing process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There seem to be several categories of cuts: things I got wrong, things that seem like bragging, flames, digressions, stretches of awkward prose, and unnecessary words."}]}

Those things you have to write in school are not only not essays; they're one of the most pointless of all the pointless hoops you have to jump through in school. I worry that they not only teach students the wrong things about writing but also put them off writing entirely."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the focus of writing instruction shifted in schools across the country?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The teaching of writing has gotten mixed together with the study of literature.

Immediately, Alien Studies would become the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly discovering things for ourselves, we could simply absorb everything they had discovered. This scenario is reminiscent of Europe in 1200 when classical texts began to circulate. These texts contained not just new answers, but new questions.

In the early era, philology actually mattered. The texts that filtered into Europe were all corrupted to some degree by the errors of translators and copyists. Scholars had to figure out what Aristotle said before they could figure out what he meant. But by the modern era, such questions were answered as well as they were ever going to be. And so, the study of ancient texts became less about ancientness and more about texts."}]}

Public schools probably couldn't stop teaching English even if they wanted to; they're probably required to by law. But here's a related suggestion that goes with the grain instead of against it: that universities establish a writing major. Many of the students who now major in English would major in writing if they could, and most would be better off."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can traditional English classes negatively impact a student's love for reading?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, English classes may even be harmful. In my case, they were effectively aversion therapy. Want to make someone dislike a book? Force him to read it and write an essay about it. And make the topic so intellectually bogus that you could not, if asked, explain why one ought to write about it. I love to read more than anything, but by the end of high school, I never read the books we were assigned. I was so disgusted with what we were doing that it became a point of honor for me to write nonsense at least as good as the other students' without having more than glanced over the book to learn the names of the characters and a few random events in it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did the author face in understanding the expectations of English classes in college?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I hoped this might be fixed in college, but I found the same problem there. It was not the teachers; it was English. We were supposed to read novels and write essays about them. About what, and why? No one seemed to be able to explain. Eventually, by trial and error, I found that what the teacher wanted us to do was pretend that the story had really taken place and to analyze, based on what the characters said and did (the subtler clues, the better), what their motives must have been. One got extra credit for motives having to do with class, as I suspect one must now for those involving gender and sexuality. I learned how to churn out such stuff well enough to get an A, but I never took another English class."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between a thesis and a dissertation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most people treat the words \"thesis\" and \"dissertation\" as interchangeable, but originally, at least, a thesis was a position one took, and the dissertation was the argument by which one defended it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the fundamental approach to starting an essay according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Figure out what? You don't know yet. And so you can't begin with a thesis, because you don't have one and may never have one. An essay doesn't begin with a statement but with a question. In a real essay, you don't take a position and defend it. You see a door that's ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what's inside."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes the writing styles of staff writers from outside writers in newsmagazines?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The writing styles of staff writers and outside writers in newsmagazines are distinct. Outside writers tend to supply editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which make a beeline toward a rousing (and foreordained) conclusion. In contrast, staff writers feel obliged to write something more nuanced and balanced, often exploring various angles of a story rather than pushing a singular viewpoint."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the main purpose of an essay compared to defend-a-position writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main purpose of an essay, compared to defend-a-position writing, is to search for truth rather than to assert a predetermined stance. In defend-a-position writing, you already know where you're going and want to go straight there, often blustering through obstacles and hand-waving your way across swampy ground. However, in an essay, the process is more exploratory; it is acceptable, and even expected, for the writing to meander. An essay should be interesting and reflect a genuine inquiry into the subject matter, making it suspicious if it does not meander."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the author describe their approach to writing this essay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, what you do (or what I do) is somewhere between a river and a Roman road-builder.

This essay is about writing, so I do occasionally yank it back in that direction, but it is not all the sort of essay I thought I was going to write about writing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the purpose and nature of essays?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Err on the side of the river. An essay is not a reference work. It's not something you read looking for a specific answer and feel cheated if you don't find it. I'd much rather read an essay that went off in an unexpected but interesting direction than one that plodded dutifully along a prescribed course."}]}

Like the Aeneid, Paradise Lost is a rock imitating a butterfly that happened to get fossilized.

One day, when the stock was trading around $200, I sat down and calculated what I thought the price should be. The answer I got was $12. I went to the next cubicle and told my friend Trevor. \"Twelve!\" he said. He tried to sound indignant, but he didn't quite manage it. He knew as well as I did that our valuation was crazy."}]}

It was not just our price-to-earnings ratio that was bogus; half our earnings were too. Not in the Enron way, of course. The finance guys seemed scrupulous about reporting earnings. What made our earnings bogus was that Yahoo was, in effect, the center of a Ponzi scheme. Investors looked at Yahoo's earnings and said to themselves, \"Here is proof that Internet companies can make money.\" So they invested in new startups that promised to be the next Yahoo. And as soon as these startups got the money, what did they do with it? They bought millions of dollars' worth of advertising on Yahoo to promote their brand. The result: a capital investment in a startup this quarter shows up as Yahoo earnings next quarterâstimulating another round of investments in startups."}]}

Now anything that became fashionable during the Bubble is ipso facto unfashionable. But that's a mistakeâan even bigger mistake than believing what everyone was saying in 1999.

That did turn out to be a big deal in the long run."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What common mistake do investors make when trying to capitalize on emerging trends?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Recognizing an important trend turns out to be easier than figuring out how to profit from it.

Hence, such parodies as Pets.com."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What types of companies typically profit the most from major economic trends?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In fact, most of the money to be made from big trends is made indirectly. It was not the railroads themselves that made the most money during the railroad boom, but the companies on either side, like Carnegie's steelworks, which made the rails, and Standard Oil, which used railroads to get oil to the East Coast, where it could be shipped to Europe."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the Internet changed the way consumers access information and make choices compared to the traditional economy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The specific argument, or one of them, is that the Internet gives us more choices. In the \"old\" economy, the high cost of presenting information to people meant they had only a narrow range of options to choose from. The tiny, expensive pipeline to consumers was tellingly named \"the channel.\" Control the channel, and you could feed them what you wanted, on your terms. It was not just big corporations that depended on this principle; labor unions, the traditional news media, and the art and literary establishments did as well. Winning depended not on doing good work, but on gaining control of some bottleneck."}]}

It's very easy for people to switch to a new search engine. It costs little effort and no money to try a new one, and it's easy to see if the results are better. And so Google doesn't maintain its dominance as effectively as it might like."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the Internet changed the way new creators can establish their reputation and succeed in their fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The exciting thing about the Internet is that it's shifting everything in that direction. The hard part, if you want to win by making the best stuff, is the beginning. Eventually, everyone will learn by word of mouth that you're the best, but how do you survive to that point? It is in this crucial stage that the Internet has the most effect. First, the Internet lets anyone find you at almost zero cost. Second, it dramatically speeds up the rate at which reputation spreads by word of mouth. Together, these mean that in many fields the rule will be: Build it, and they will come.

In that department, there are 26-year-olds who can compete with anyone."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the role of a company president evolved in relation to technology and technical expertise since 1970?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In 1970, a company president meant someone in his fifties, at least. If he had technologists working for him, they were treated like a racing stable: prized, but not powerful. But as technology has grown more important, the power of nerds has grown to reflect it. Now it's not enough for a CEO to have someone smart he can ask about technical matters. Increasingly, he has to be that person himself."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the criticism of formality in professional settings according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The problem with formality is that dressing up is not so much bad in itself.

So what's the connection between nerds and technology? Roughly that you can't fool mother nature. In technical matters, you have to get the right answers. If your software miscalculates the path of a space probe, you can't finesse your way out of trouble by saying that your code is patriotic, avant-garde, or any of the other dodges people use in nontechnical fields."}]}

When I was in college in the mid-1980s, \"nerd\" was still an insult. People who majored in computer science generally tried to conceal it. Now, women ask me where they can meet nerds.

During the railroad boom, some executives enriched themselves by selling watered stockâby issuing more shares than they said were outstanding. But that doesn't make common stock a bad idea. Crooks just use whatever means are available."}]}

Not surprisingly, people do what you pay them to. If you pay them by the hour, they'll work a lot of hours. If you pay them by the volume of work done, they'll get a lot of work done (but only as you defined work).

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do large companies often prefer acquiring startups for technology rather than developing it internally?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In many businesses, it just makes more sense for companies to get technology by buying startups rather than developing it in-house. You pay more, but there is less risk, and risk is what big companies don't want. It makes the people developing the technology more accountable because they only get paid if they build the winner. And you end up with better technology, created faster, because things are made in the innovative atmosphere of startups instead of the bureaucratic atmosphere of big companies."}]}

Not at all. When I drive down 101 from the airport, I still feel a buzz of energy, as if there were a giant transformer nearby. Real estate is still more expensive than just about anywhere else in the country. The people still look healthy, and the weather is still fabulous. The future is there.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the rationale behind high price to earnings ratios during the Bubble, and what trend is anticipated for the future?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "During the Bubble, optimistic analysts justified high price-to-earnings ratios by claiming that technology would dramatically increase productivity. They were wrong about the specific companies, but not so wrong about the underlying principle. I think one of the big trends we'll see in the coming century is a huge increase in productivity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does technology impact productivity levels?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Technology impacts productivity levels significantly. It acts as a lever; it doesn't just add to productivity, it multiplies it. If the current range of productivity is 0 to 100, introducing a multiple of 10 increases the range from 0 to 1000."}]}

I sometimes daydream about how big you could grow a company (in revenues) without ever having more than ten people. What would happen if you outsourced everything except product development? If you tried this experiment, I think you'd be surprised at how far you could get. As Fred Brooks pointed out, small groups are intrinsically more productive because the internal friction in a group grows as the square of its size."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact does increasing company size have on productivity, according to recent management perspectives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Until quite recently, running a major company meant managing an army of workers. Our standards about how many employees a company should have are still influenced by old patterns. Startups are perforce small because they can't afford to hire a lot of people. But I think it's a big mistake for companies to loosen their belts as revenues increase. The question is not whether you can afford the extra salaries; can you afford the loss in productivity that comes from making the company bigger?"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors are anticipated to influence success in the coming century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When one looks over these trends, is there any overall theme? There does seem to be: that in the coming century, good ideas will count for more. That 26-year-olds with good ideas will increasingly have an edge over 50-year-olds with powerful connections. That doing good work will matter more than dressing upâor advertising, which is the same thing for companies. That people will be rewarded a bit more in proportion to the value of what they create."}]}

Good ideas always tend to win eventually. The problem is that it can take a very long time. It took decades for relativity to be accepted and the greater part of a century to establish that central planning didn't work. So even a small increase in the rate at which good ideas win would be a momentous changeâbig enough, probably, to justify a name like the \"new economy.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can we determine if a stock was overvalued?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine if a stock was overvalued, we must consider that the value of a stock is based on its future earnings.

Certainly, schools should teach students how to write. But due to a series of historical accidents, the teaching of writing has gotten mixed together with the study of literature. And so, all over the country, students are writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about symbolism in Dickens."}]}

These earlier civilizations were so much more sophisticated that for the next several centuries, the main work of European scholars, in almost every field, was to assimilate what they knew."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the study of modern texts often viewed differently from the study of ancient texts in scholarship?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern texts? The answer, of course, is that the original raison d'Ãªtre of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaeology that does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors. But for obvious reasons, no one wanted to give that answer. The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that those studying the classics were, if not wasting their time, at least working on problems of minor importance."}]}

Dartmouth, the University of Vermont, Amherst, and University College, London taught English literature in the 1820s."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What influence did the German educational model have on the development of modern universities in the US?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What tipped the scales, at least in the US, seems to have been the idea that professors should do research as well as teach. This idea (along with the PhD, the department, and indeed the whole concept of the modern university) was imported from Germany in the late 19th century. Beginning at Johns Hopkins in 1876, the new model spread rapidly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of having English professors teach writing in the late 19th century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the late 19th century, the teaching of writing was inherited by English professors. This had two drawbacks: (a) an expert on literature need not himself be a good writer, any more than an art historian has to be a good painter, and (b) the subject of writing now tended to be literature, since that's what the professor was interested in."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the curriculum changes in the 19th century influence the writing practices of high school students?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "High schools imitate universities. The seeds of our miserable high school experiences were sown in 1892, when the National Education Association formally recommended that literature and composition be unified in the high school course. The writing component of the 3 Rs then morphed into English, with the bizarre consequence that high school students now had to write about English literatureâto write, without even realizing it, imitations of whatever English professors had been publishing in their journals a few decades before."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might students perceive the study of classical scholarship as a disconnected and unimportant exercise?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's no wonder if this seems to the student a pointless exercise because we're now three steps removed from real work: the students are imitating English professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the primary focus of medieval universities, and how did their approach to education influence the development of argumentative skills?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is often mistakenly believed that medieval universities were mostly seminaries. In fact, they were more like law schools. In our tradition, lawyers are advocates, trained to take either side of an argument and make as good a case for it as they can. Whether cause or effect, this spirit pervaded early universities. The study of rhetoric, the art of arguing persuasively, constituted a third of the undergraduate curriculum. After the lecture, the most common form of discussion was the disputation. This is at least nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense: most people treat the words thesis and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least, a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was the argument by which one defended it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of defending a position in a legal dispute when seeking the truth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Defending a position may be a necessary evil in a legal dispute, but it's not the best way to get at the truth, as I think lawyers would be the first to admit. It's not just that you miss subtleties this way. The real problem is that you can't change the question."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of a conclusion in a high school essay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The purpose of a conclusion in a high school essay is often misunderstood. This principle is built into the very structure of the things they teach you to write in high school. The topic sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance; the supporting paragraphs are the blows you strike in the conflict, and the conclusionâuh, what is the conclusion? I was never sure about that in high school. It seemed as if we were just supposed to restate what we said in the first paragraph, but in different enough words that no one could tell. Why bother? But when you understand the origins of this sort of \"essay,\" you can see where the conclusion comes from. It's the concluding remarks to the jury."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should be prioritized in writing to ensure it is effective and convincing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good writing should be convincing, certainly, but it should be convincing because you got the right answers, not because you did a good job of arguing. When I give a draft of an essay to friends, there are two things I want to know: which parts bore them and which seem unconvincing. The boring bits can usually be fixed by cutting. But I don't try to fix the unconvincing bits by arguing more cleverly. I need to talk the matter over."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between clarity in communication and the pursuit of truth in writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At the very least, I must have explained something badly. In that case, in the course of the conversation, I'll be forced to come up with a clearer explanation, which I can just incorporate into the essay. More often than not, I have to change what I was saying as well. But the aim is never to be convincing per se. As the reader gets smarter, convincing and true become identical, so if I can convince smart readers, I must be near the truth."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the initial approach one should take when starting to write an essay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Figure out what? You don't know yet. And so you can't begin with a thesis because you don't have one and may never have one. An essay doesn't begin with a statement but with a question. In a real essay, you don't take a position and defend it. You notice a door that's ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what's inside."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does writing play in the development of ideas according to Montaigne?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need to write anything, though? Why not just sit and think? Well, there precisely is Montaigne's great discovery. Expressing ideas helps to form them. Indeed, \"helps\" is far too weak a word. Most of what ends up in my essays I only thought of when I sat down to write them. That's why I write them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between writing for school and writing a personal essay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the things you write in school, you are, in theory, merely explaining yourself to the reader. In a personal essay, you're writing for yourself. You're thinking out loud."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does having an audience impact the quality of writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Having an audience impacts the quality of writing significantly. Just as inviting people over forces you to clean up your apartment, writing something that other people will read compels you to think more critically. It does matter to have an audience. The things I've written just for myself are no good; they tend to peter out. When I run into difficulties, I find I conclude with a few vague questions and then drift off to get a cup of tea."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do staff writers for newsmagazines often avoid taking a definitive stance on controversial issues?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many published essays peter out in the same way, particularly those written by the staff writers of newsmagazines. Outside writers tend to supply editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which make a beeline toward a rousing (and foreordained) conclusion. But the staff writers feel obliged to write something \"balanced.\" Since they're writing for a popular magazine, they start with the most radioactively controversial questions, from whichâbecause they're writing for a popular magazineâthey then proceed to recoil in terror. Abortion, for or against? This group says one thing. That group says another. One thing is certain: the question is a complex one. (But don't get mad at us. We didn't draw any conclusions.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary purpose of writing and publishing an essay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An essay has to come up with answers. They don't always, of course. Sometimes you start with a promising question and get nowhere, but those you don't publish. Those are like experiments that get inconclusive results. An essay you publish ought to tell the reader something he didn't already know."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of the Meander River's winding path?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Meander (aka Menderes) is a river in Turkey. As you might expect, it winds all over the place. But it doesn't do this out of frivolity. The path it has discovered is the most economical route to the sea."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What guiding principle does the essayist follow when deciding the direction of their writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The river's algorithm is simple. At each step, flow down. For the essayist, this translates to: flow interesting. Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting. One can't have quite as little foresight as a river. I always know generally what I want to write about, but not the specific conclusions I want to reach; from paragraph to paragraph, I let the ideas take their course."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy does the author use when they encounter a creative block in their writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This doesn't always work. Sometimes, like a river, one runs up against a wall. Then I do the same thing the river does: backtrack. At one point in this essay, I found that after following a certain thread, I ran out of ideas. I had to go back seven paragraphs and start over in another direction."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between an essay and the process of refining thoughts in writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fundamentally, an essay is a train of thoughtâbut a cleaned-up train of thought, as dialogue is cleaned-up conversation. Real thought, like real conversation, is full of false starts. It would be exhausting to read. You need to cut and fill to emphasize the central thread, like an illustrator inking over a pencil drawing. But don't change so much that you lose the spontaneity of the original."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the role of surprise in the design of interfaces and essays?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So what's interesting? For me, interesting means surprise. Interfaces, as Geoffrey James has said, should follow the principle of least astonishment. A button that looks like it will make a machine stop should make it stop, not speed up. Essays should do the opposite; they should aim for maximum surprise."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an effective way to learn about travel experiences from others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel vicariously. When friends came back from faraway places, it wasn't just out of politeness that I asked what they saw. I really wanted to know. I found the best way to get information out of them was to ask what surprised them. How was the place different from what they expected? This is an extremely useful question. You can ask it of the most unobservant people, and it will extract information they didn't even know they were recording."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What makes surprises particularly valuable in terms of knowledge and understanding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Surprises are things that you not only didn't know, but that contradict things you thought you knew. Therefore, they're the most valuable sort of fact you can get. They're like a food that's not merely healthy but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things you've already eaten."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key to finding engaging topics in essay writing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How do you find surprises? Well, therein lies half the work of essay writing. (The other half is expressing yourself well.) The trick is to use yourself as a proxy for the reader. You should only write about things you've thought about a lot. And anything you come across that surprises you, who have thought about the topic a lot, will probably surprise most readers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What can make even mundane jobs, like working in fast food, seem interesting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What should you think about? My guess is that it doesn't matterâthat anything can be interesting if you get deeply enough into it. One possible exception might be things that have deliberately had all the variation sucked out of them, like working in fast food. In retrospect, was there anything interesting about working at Baskin-Robbins? Well, it was interesting how important color was to the customers. Kids a certain age would point into the case and say that they wanted yellow. Did they want French Vanilla or Lemon? They would just look at you blankly. They wanted yellow. And then there was the mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines 'n' Cream was so appealing. (I think now it was the salt.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do fathers and mothers differ in their approach to buying ice cream for their children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The difference in the way fathers and mothers buy ice cream for their kids is notable: fathers act like benevolent kings bestowing largesse, while mothers appear harried, often giving in to pressure. So, yes, there does seem to be some material even in fast food."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the narrator's perception of their past experiences change with time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I didn't notice those things at the time, though. At sixteen, I was about as observant as a lump of rock. I can see more now in the fragments of memory I preserve from that age than I could see at the time, with it all happening live right in front of me."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of questioning the relationship between humor and misfortune?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I find it especially useful to ask why about things that seem wrong. For example, why should there be a connection between humor and misfortune? Why do we find it funny when a character, even one we like, slips on a banana peel? There's a whole essay's worth of surprises there, for sure."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can skepticism contribute to recognizing flaws in established systems, such as education?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you want to notice things that seem wrong, you'll find a degree of skepticism helpful. I take it as an axiom that we're only achieving 1% of what we could. This helps counteract the rule that gets beaten into our heads as children: that things are the way they are because that is how things have to be. For example, everyone I've talked to while writing this essay felt the same about English classesâthat the whole process seemed pointless. But none of us had the courage at the time to hypothesize that it was, in fact, all a mistake. We all thought there was just something we weren't getting."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is humor important in presenting good ideas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Humor is important in presenting good ideas because it captures attention and engages the audience. I have a hunch you want to pay attention not just to things that seem wrong, but to things that seem wrong in a humorous way. I'm always pleased when I see someone laugh as they read a draft of an essay. But why should I be? I'm aiming for good ideas. Why should good ideas be funny? The connection may be surprise. Surprises make us laugh, and surprises are what one wants to deliver."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary benefit of keeping a notebook, according to the author?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I write down things that surprise me in notebooks. I never actually get around to reading them and using what I've written, but I do tend to reproduce the same thoughts later. So the main value of notebooks may be what writing things down leaves in your head."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some effective strategies for discovering unexpected connections between different fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the keys to finding unexpected connections is to study lots of different things. Some of the most interesting surprises arise from the intersections between various fields. For example, jam, bacon, pickles, and cheese, which are among the most pleasing of foods, were all originally intended as methods of preservation. So were books and paintings."}]}

If there's one piece of advice I would give about writing essays, it would be: don't do as you're told. Don't believe what you're supposed to.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the traditional gatekeeping in essay writing impacted the diversity of perspectives presented in publications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It used to be that only a tiny number of officially approved writers were allowed to write essays. Magazines published few of them and judged them less by what they said than by who wrote them; a magazine might publish a story by an unknown writer if it was good enough, but if they published an essay on a specific topic, it had to be by someone who was at least forty and whose job title included that topic. This is a problem because there are a lot of things insiders can't say precisely because they're insiders."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the Internet transformed the way we evaluate written content?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Internet is changing that.

There was a sudden drop-off in scholarship just as Europeans finished assimilating classical science. The trend in scientific progress matches the population curve."}]}

For programmers, the paradox is even more pronounced: the language to learn, if you want to get a good job, is a language that people don't learn merely to get a job."}]}

He says the main reason is that he likes the way source code looks. That may seem a frivolous reason to choose one language over another, but it is not so frivolous as it sounds: when you program, you spend more time reading code than writing it. You push blobs of source code around the way a sculptor does blobs of clay. So a language that makes source code ugly is maddening to an exacting programmer, as clay full of lumps would be to a sculptor."}]}

As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second outdated, and the third empirically false. Could it be that, in a modern democracy, variation in income is actually a sign of health?"}]}

Money is just a convenient way of trading one form of wealth for another. Wealth is the underlying stuffâthe goods and services we buy. When you travel to a rich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank accounts to tell which kind you're in.

People make it. This was easier to grasp when most people lived on farms and made many of the things they wanted with their own hands. Then you could see in the house, the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created. It was obvious then, too, that the wealth of the world was not a fixed quantity that had to be shared out, like slices of a pie. If you wanted more wealth, you could make it."}]}

If you want something, you either have to make it or do something of equivalent value for someone else in order to get them to give you enough money to buy it. In the real world, wealth is (except for a few specialists like thieves and speculators) something you have to create, not something that's distributed by Daddy.

Why else would this idea occur in this odd context? Whereas if the speaker were still operating on the Daddy Model and saw wealth as something that flowed from a common source and had to be shared out, rather than something generated by doing what other people wanted, this is exactly what you'd get on noticing that some people made much more than others."}]}

Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor poor, but originally they were a distinct group.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the key differences in economic incentives between the middle class and serfs in medieval society?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like serfs, the middle class made a living largely by creating wealth. (In port cities like Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs, they had an incentive to create a lot of it. Any wealth a serf created belonged to his master. There was not much point in making more than you could hide. Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the Industrial Revolution influence perceptions of wealth creation and corruption in England?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was not until the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich. In England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in fact only started to be called \"corruption\") when there began to be other, faster ways to get rich."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the emergence of the middle class change the dynamics of wealth creation in the economy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero-sum game. Jobs and Wozniak didn't have to make us poor to make themselves rich. Quite the opposite: they created things that made our lives materially richer. They had to, or we wouldn't have paid for them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do many people harbor suspicions towards wealthy individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many people harbor suspicions towards wealthy individuals because, for most of the world's history, the main route to wealth was through theft. This historical context leads us to be wary of rich people. Idealistic undergraduates often find their unconsciously preserved childhood model of wealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past. It is a case of the mistaken meeting the outdated."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What did Balzac imply about the origins of great fortunes in the context of his time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Behind every great fortune, there is a crime,\" Balzac wrote. Except he didn't. What he actually said was that a great fortune with no apparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executed that it had been forgotten. If we were talking about Europe in 1000, or most of the third world today, the standard misquotation would be spot on. But Balzac lived in nineteenth-century France, where the Industrial Revolution was well advanced. He knew you could make a fortune without stealing it. After all, he did himself, as a popular novelist."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the nature of work opportunities for high school students changed over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Iâve seen the level of technology grow visibly in my own time. In high school, I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at Baskin-Robbins. This was the only kind of work available at the time. Now high school kids can write software or design websites. But only some of them will; the rest will still be scooping ice cream."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did advancements in technology in the 1980s impact personal computing and freelance work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I remember very vividly when, in 1985, improved technology made it possible for me to buy a computer of my own. Within months, I was using it to make money as a freelance programmer. A few years before, I couldn't have done this. A few years before, there was no such opportunity."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might companies prefer to produce mass-market cars over custom-made ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cars are a good example of why companies might prefer to produce mass-market vehicles over custom-made ones. It's possible to buy expensive, handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, but there is not much point. Companies make more money by building a large number of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones. Therefore, a company making a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more on its design. If you buy a custom-made car, something will always be breaking. The only point of buying one now is to advertise that you can."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the advancement in watch technology affected the relationship between price and performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Consider watches. Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of money on a watch, you could get better performance. When watches had mechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time. Not anymore. Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex is more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands of dollars."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some drawbacks of owning a mechanical watch compared to a quartz watch?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, as with expensive cars, if you're determined to spend a lot of money on a watch, you have to put up with some inconvenience to do it. As well as keeping worse time, mechanical watches have to be wound."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of brand value changed in relation to wealth and technology over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The only thing technology can't cheapen is brand, which is precisely why we hear ever more about it. Brand is the residue left as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate. However, what label you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having it versus not having it. In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one asked what year or brand it was. If you had one, you were rich. And if you weren't rich, you took the omnibus or walked. Now, even the poorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we're so well trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especially expensive ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does demand influence the development and pricing of technology in various industries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The same pattern has played out in industry after industry. If there is enough demand for something, technology will make it cheap enough to sell in large volumes, and the mass-produced versions will be, if not better, at least more convenient."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do wealthy individuals often choose to work despite having the financial means to avoid it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The rich spend their time more like everyone else, too. Bertie Wooster seems long gone. Now, most people who are rich enough not to work do anyway. It's not just social pressure that makes them; idleness is lonely and demoralizing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How have social expectations regarding friendships changed for women after marriage from the 19th century to today?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In 1880, it may be found necessary, in some cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on assuming the responsibility of a household, many of those friendships commenced in the earlier part of her life. A woman who married a rich man was expected to drop friends who didn't share her social status. You would seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today, and you would also have a very boring life. People still tend to segregate themselves somewhat, but much more on the basis of education than wealth."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the author suggest about the relationship between income variation and technological innovation in modern society?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would like to propose an alternative idea: that in modern society, increasing variation in income is a sign of health. Technology seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than linear rates. If we don't see corresponding variation in income, there are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation has stopped, (b) that the people who would create the most wealth aren't doing it, or (c) that they aren't getting paid for it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the ability to accumulate wealth varied throughout different historical periods and locations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At various times and places in history, the ability to accumulate a fortune by creating wealth has been turned on and off. In Northern Italy in 800, it was off (warlords would steal it). In Northern Italy in 1100, it was on. In Central France in 1100, it was off (still feudal). In England in 1800, it was on. In England in 1974, it was off (98% tax on investment income). In the United States in 1974, it was on. We've even had a twin study: West Germany, on; East Germany, off. In every case, the creation of wealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as you switch on and off the prospect of keeping it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the economic consequences of suppressing income variations in society?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be the same: society as a whole ends up poorer."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the importance of absolute poverty versus relative poverty in societal living conditions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially much better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one where I was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I'd take the first option. If I had children, it would arguably be immoral not to. It's absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relative poverty. If, as the evidence so far implies, you have to have one or the other in your society, take relative poverty."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the discussion around wealth often contentious among certain groups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Part of the reason this subject is so contentious is that some of those most vocal on the subject of wealthâuniversity students, heirs, professors, politicians, and journalistsâhave the least experience creating it. (This phenomenon will be familiar to anyone who has overheard conversations about sports in a bar.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might individuals perceive the distribution of resources by a central authority as unfair compared to voluntary exchanges in the economy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Individuals might perceive the distribution of resources by a central authority as unfair compared to voluntary exchanges in the economy because resources are doled out according to some abstract notion of fairness (or randomly, in the case of heirs), rather than being given by other people in return for something they wanted. As a result, it may seem to them unfair that things don't work the same way in the rest of the economy."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the highest price ever paid for a slave according to historical records, and who was the notable individual involved?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The highest price ever paid for a slave, according to historical records, was 700,000 sestertii for the linguist (and presumably teacher) Daphnis. This amount was noted in vii.39, but it is mentioned that this price had since been exceeded by actors buying their own freedom."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the Daddy Model's perception of hard work differ from the reality of measuring value in work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the biggest divergences between the Daddy Model and reality is the valuation of hard work. In the Daddy Model, hard work is in itself deserving. In reality, wealth is measured by what one delivers, not how much effort it costs. If I paint someone's house, the owner shouldn't pay me extra for doing it with a toothbrush."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What actions and qualities contributed to Thomas Lord Roos's rise in favor during the reign of Henry VIII?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From the beginning of the reign, Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous courtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards. In 1525, he was made a Knight of the Garter and given the Earldom of Rutland. In the thirties, his support of the breach with Rome, his zeal in crushing the Pilgrimage of Grace, and his readiness to vote the death penalty in the succession of spectacular treason trials that punctuated Henry's erratic matrimonial progress made him an obvious candidate for grants of monastic property."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the timekeeping accuracy of a Timex compared to a high-end mechanical watch like the Patek Philippe 10 Day Tourbillon?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A Timex will gain or lose about 0.5 seconds per day.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to consider real income when discussing income trends?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To say anything meaningful about income trends, you have to talk about real income, or income as measured by what it can buy. However, the usual way of calculating real income ignores much of the growth in wealth over time because it depends on a consumer price index created by bolting end to end a series of numbers that are only locally accurate and that don't include the prices of new inventions until they become so common that their prices stabilize."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What trade goods from the present would be most valuable if transported back to specific years in the past?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another approach would be to ask, if you were going back to the year X in a time machine, how much would you have to spend on trade goods to make your fortune? For example, if you were going back to 1970, it would certainly be less than $500, because the processing power you can get for $500 today would have been worth at least $150 million in 1970. The function goes asymptotic fairly quickly, because for times over a hundred years or so, you could get all you needed in present-day trash. In 1800, an empty plastic drink bottle with a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can admissions processes improve their security measures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson from the example of computer security and, instead of just assuming that their system can't be hacked, measure the degree to which it is."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the meanings of \"hacker\" differ between the popular press and the programming community?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To the popular press, \"hacker\" means someone who breaks into computers. Among programmers, it means a good programmer. However, the two meanings are connected. To programmers, \"hacker\" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what they wantâwhether the computer wants to or not."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the different meanings of the term \"hack\" and how are they perceived?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To add to the confusion, the noun \"hack\" also has two senses. It can be either a compliment or an insult. It's called a hack when you do something in an ugly way. However, when you do something so clever that you somehow beat the system, that's also called a hack. The word is used more often in the former than the latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more common than brilliant ones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between ugly and imaginative solutions in the context of rule-breaking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Believe it or not, the two senses of \"hack\" are also connected. Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in common: they both break the rules. There is a gradual continuum between rule-breaking that's merely ugly (using duct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule-breaking that is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space)."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What historical examples illustrate that hacking has existed long before the advent of modern computers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hacking predates computers. When he was working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman used to amuse himself by breaking into safes containing secret documents. This tradition continues today. When we were in grad school, a hacker friend of mine who spent too much time around MIT had his own lock-picking kit. (He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do individuals face when explaining their motives for hacking to law enforcement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would want to do such things. Another friend of mine once got in trouble with the government for breaking into computers. This had only recently been declared a crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative technique didn't work. Police investigation apparently begins with a motive. The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex, revenge. Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives on the FBI's list. Indeed, the whole concept seemed foreign to them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the attitude of disobedience in hackers relate to their programming skills?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Those in authority tend to be annoyed by hackers' general attitude of disobedience. But that disobedience is a byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers. They may laugh at the CEO when he talks in generic corporate newspeak, but they also laugh at someone who tells them a certain problem can't be solved. Suppress one, and you suppress the other."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can imitating the attitudes of successful hackers hinder innovation among young programmers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This attitude is sometimes affected. Young programmers may notice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide to adopt some of their own in order to seem smarter. The fake version is not merely annoying; the prickly attitude of these posers can actually slow the process of innovation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do hackers view measures like copyrights and patents as a threat to their work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To prevent copying, show any hacker a lock and his first thought is how to pick it. But there is a deeper reason that hackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and patents. They see increasingly aggressive measures to protect \"intellectual property\" as a threat to the intellectual freedom they need to do their job. And they are right."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do hackers contribute to the development of the next generation of computer technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is by poking about inside current technology that hackers get ideas for the next generation. No thanks, intellectual homeowners may say, we don't need any outside help. But they're wrong. The next generation of computer technology has oftenâperhaps more often than notâbeen developed by outsiders."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What operating system was created as an alternative to Multics by two individuals who found it overly complex?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In Los Altos, at about the same time, the powers that be were cooperating to develop the official next generation operating system, Multics. But two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off and wrote their own. They gave it a name that was a joking reference to Multics: Unix."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do recent intellectual property laws impact innovation and the development of new technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The latest intellectual property laws impose unprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that leads to new ideas. In the past, a competitor might use patents to prevent you from selling a copy of something they made, but they couldn't prevent you from taking one apart to see how it worked. The latest laws make this a crime. How are we to develop new technology if we can't study current technology to figure out how to improve it?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential consequences of strict intellectual property laws in the digital age?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Data is, by definition, easy to copy, and the Internet makes copies easy to distribute. So it is no wonder companies are afraid. But, as so often happens, fear has clouded their judgment. The government has responded with draconian laws to protect intellectual property. They probably mean well, but they may not realize that such laws will do more harm than good."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What cultural traits contribute to the prominence of hacking and innovation in America compared to other countries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hackers are unruly.

In those countries, people color inside the lines."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the author come to about their time in Florence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I lived for a while in Florence. But after I'd been there a few months, I realized that what I'd been unconsciously hoping to find there was back in the place I'd just left. The reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was like New York. In 1450, it was filled with the kind of turbulent and ambitious people you find now in America. (So I went back to America.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do hackers express concern about government surveillance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is why hackers worry: the government spying on people doesn't literally make programmers write worse code. It just eventually leads to a world in which bad ideas win. Because this is so important to hackers, they're especially sensitive to it. They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a distance, as animals can sense an approaching thunderstorm."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What unintended consequences might arise from recent national security measures aimed at protecting intellectual property?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures intended to protect national security and intellectual property turned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes America successful.

There's nothing like living abroad to teach you that. And if you want to know whether something will nurture or squash this quality, it would be hard to find a better focus group than hackers, because they come closest of any group I know to embodying it. Closer, probably, than the men running our government, who for all their talk of patriotism remind me more of Richelieu or Mazarin than Thomas Jefferson or George Washington."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the sayings of the founding fathers influence contemporary American leadership?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Imagine an American president saying that today.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential consequences of violating societal moral fashions compared to simply wearing unusual clothing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What scares me is that there are moral fashions too. They're just as arbitrary and just as invisible to most people. But they're much more dangerous. Fashion is mistaken for good design; moral fashion is mistaken for good. Dressing oddly gets you laughed at, while violating moral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or even killed."}]}

We're looking for things we can't say that are true, or at least have enough chance of being true that the question should remain open. But many of the things people get in trouble for saying probably do make it over this second, lower threshold. No one gets in trouble for saying that 2 + 2 is 5, or that people in Pittsburgh are ten feet tall. Such obviously false statements might be treated as jokes, or at worst as evidence of insanity, but they are not likely to make anyone mad. The statements that make people mad are the ones they worry might be believed. I suspect the statements that make people maddest are those they worry might be true."}]}

But in Germany in 1917, it was a weapon used by Ludendorff in a purge of those who favored a negotiated peace. At the start of World War II, it was used extensively by Churchill and his supporters to silence their opponents.

We have such labels today, of course, quite a lot of them, from the all-purpose \"inappropriate\" to the dreaded \"divisive.\" In any period, it should be easy to figure out what such labels are, simply by looking at what people call ideas they disagree with besides \"untrue.\" When a politician says his opponent is mistaken, that's a straightforward criticism, but when he attacks a statement as \"divisive\" or \"racially insensitive\" instead of arguing that it's false, we should start paying attention."}]}

They found that even when the radiologists missed a cancerous lesion, their eyes had usually paused at the site of it.

Many of my friends who are starting to have children are trying not to use words like \"fuck\" and \"shit\" within the baby's hearing, lest the baby start using these words too. While these words are part of the language and adults use them all the time, parents are concerned about giving their kids an inaccurate idea of language by not exposing them to it. They believe it is not fitting for children to use the whole language, as we prefer to maintain a sense of innocence in children."}]}

The specifics don't matter â just someone who has seen a lot. Now imagine comparing what's inside this guy's head with what's inside the head of a well-behaved sixteen-year-old girl from the suburbs. What does he think would shock her?

Ordinary fashions seem to arise by accident when everyone imitates the whim of some influential person. The fashion for broad-toed shoes in late fifteenth-century Europe began because Charles VIII of France had six toes on one foot. The fashion for the name Gary began when the actor Frank Cooper adopted the name of a tough mill town in Indiana. Moral fashions more often seem to be created deliberately.

The English Reformation was, at bottom, a struggle for wealth and power, but it ended up being cast as a struggle to preserve the souls of Englishmen from the corrupting influence of Rome.

The early adopters will be driven by ambition: self-consciously cool people who want to distinguish themselves from the common herd. As the fashion becomes established, they'll be joined by a second, much larger group, driven by fear. This second group adopts the fashion not because they want to stand out but because they are afraid of standing out."}]}

What groups are powerful yet nervous, and which ideas would they like to suppress? What ideas have been tarnished by association after ending up on the losing side of a recent struggle?

Or it could be because it's clearer in the sciences whether theories are true or false, and this makes scientists bolder.

There is a lot of hand-wringing within the US car industry about this issue, but the cause is so obvious that any observant outsider could explain it in a second: they make bad cars. They have done so for so long that now US car brands are considered antibrandsâsomething you'd buy a car despite, not because of. Cadillac stopped being the Cadillac of cars around 1970.

If you argue against censorship in general, you can avoid being accused of whatever heresy is contained in the book or film that someone is trying to censor. You can attack labels with meta-labels: labels that refer to the use of labels to prevent discussion.

For centuries, the Low Countries were the place to go to express ideas that could not be voiced elsewhere, which helped establish the region as a center of scholarship and industryâtwo fields that have been closely tied for longer than most people realize.

If a statement is false, that's the worst thing you can say about it. You don't need to say that it's heretical. And if it isn't false, it shouldn't be suppressed.

It's not just the mob you need to learn to watch from a distance; you need to be able to watch your own thoughts from a distance. That's not a radical idea, by the way; it's the main difference between children and adults. When a child gets angry because he's tired, he doesn't know what's happening.

Only sites on a blacklist would get crawled, and sites would be blacklisted only after being inspected by humans. The lifetime of a spam must be several hours at least, so it should be easy to update such a list in time to interfere with a spam promoting a new site."}]}

Indeed, this solution neatly mirrors the problem. The problem with spam is that in order to reach a few gullible people, the spammer sends mail to everyone. The non-gullible recipients are merely collateral damage. However, the non-gullible majority won't stop getting spam until they can stop (or threaten to stop) the gullible from responding to it.

Not quite. The biggest spammers could probably protect their servers against auto-retrieving filters. However, the easiest and cheapest way for them to do it would be to include working unsubscribe links in their emails. This would be a necessity for smaller fry and for \"legitimate\" sites that hired spammers to promote them.

They happily set to work proving theorems like the other mathematicians over in the math department and probably soon stop noticing that the building they work in says \"computer science\" on the outside. But for the hackers, this label is a problem. If what they're doing is called science, it makes them feel they ought to be acting scientific.

Debugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass where you caught typos and oversights. The way I worked, it seemed like programming consisted of debugging."}]}

If I had only looked over at the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would have realized that there was a name for what I was doing: sketching. As far as I can tell, the way they taught me to program in college was all wrong. You should figure out programs as you're writing them, just as writers, painters, and architects do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the author's views on the nature of programming languages and their role in the creative process of writing code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Programming languages should be tools for creating programs, not just for expressing programs you've already thought of. They should be like a pencil, not a pen. Static typing would be a fine idea if people actually wrote programs the way they taught me to in college. But that's not how any of the hackers I know write programs. We need a language that lets us scribble, smudge, and smear, not a language where you have to sit with a teacup of types balanced on your knee and make polite conversation with a strict old aunt of a compiler."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What impact does \"math envy\" have on the presentation of work in scientific fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While we're on the subject of static typing, identifying with the makers will save us from another problem that afflicts the sciences: math envy. Everyone in the sciences secretly believes that mathematicians are smarter than they are. I think mathematicians also believe this. At any rate, the result is that scientists tend to make their work look as mathematical as possible. In a field like physics, this probably doesn't do much harm, but the further you get from the natural sciences, the more of a problem it becomes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What might be a common pitfall for students when choosing math problems to solve?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A page of formulas just looks so impressive. (Tip: for extra impressiveness, use Greek variables.) There is a great temptation to work on problems you can treat formally, rather than problems that are, say, important."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the author have about the role of programmers at Yahoo after the acquisition of Viaweb?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I only discovered this myself quite recently. When Yahoo bought Viaweb, they asked me what I wanted to do. I had never liked the business side very much and said that I just wanted to hack. When I got to Yahoo, I found that what hacking meant to them was implementing software, not designing it. Programmers were seen as technicians who translated the visions (if that is the word) of product managers into code."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do large companies prefer to have software designed by committee rather than relying on individual hackers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Large companies prefer to have software designed by committee rather than relying on individual hackers because it decreases the standard deviation of the outcome. Only a small percentage of hackers can actually design software, and it's hard for the people running a company to identify these individuals. Instead of entrusting the future of the software to one brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it is designed by committee, and the hackers merely implement the design."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key advantage that startups have over big companies in terms of innovation and product design?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups have a key advantage over big companies in terms of innovation and product design because they are willing to take risks that larger organizations often avoid. Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes to avoid disasters. However, when you dampen oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low. This is not a problem for big companies, as they don't win by making great products; they win by sucking less than other big companies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the strategic advantage of entering new markets for product design and implementation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one has yet managed to establish any fortifications. That's where you can win big by taking a bold approach to design and having the same people both design and implement the product. Microsoft did this at the start. So did Apple and Hewlett-Packard. I suspect almost every successful startup has."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do startups face in aligning profitable software development with engaging programming tasks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other problem with startups is that there is not much overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the kind that's interesting to write. Programming languages are interesting to write, and Microsoft's first product was one, in fact, but no one will pay for programming languages now. If you want to make money, you tend to be forced to work on problems that are too nasty for anyone to solve for free."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do creative professionals encounter in monetizing their work compared to more conventional jobs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All makers face this problem. Prices are determined by supply and demand, and there is just not as much demand for things that are fun to work on as there is for things that solve the mundane problems of individual customers. Acting in off-Broadway plays just doesn't pay as well as wearing a gorilla suit in someone's booth at a trade show. Writing novels doesn't pay as well as writing ad copy for garbage disposals. And hacking programming languages doesn't pay as well as figuring out how to connect some company's legacy database to their web server."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What types of day jobs do makers typically have early in their careers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nearly all makers have day jobs early in their careers. Painters and writers notoriously do. If you're lucky, you can get a day job that's closely related to your real work. Musicians often seem to work in record stores. A hacker working on some programming language or operating system might likewise be able to get a day job using it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between open-source hacking and the idea of hackers having day jobs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I say that the answer is for hackers to have day jobs and work on beautiful software on the side, I'm not proposing this as a new idea. This is what open-source hacking is all about. What I'm saying is that open-source is probably the right model because it has been independently confirmed by all the other makers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some employers value open-source project experience in potential hires?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems surprising to me that any employer would be reluctant to let hackers work on open-source projects. At Viaweb, we would have been reluctant to hire anyone who didn't. When we interviewed programmers, the main thing we cared about was what kind of software they wrote in their spare time. You can't do anything really well unless you love it, and if you love to hack, you'll inevitably be working on projects of your own."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do most hackers acquire their skills?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One thing we can learn, or at least confirm, from the example of painting is how to learn to hack. You learn to paint mostly by doing it. Ditto for hacking. Most hackers don't learn to hack by taking college courses in programming. They learn to hack by writing programs of their own at age thirteen. Even in college classes, you learn to hack mostly by hacking."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can observing a painter's body of work reveal their artistic development and learning process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because painters leave a trail of work behind them, you can watch them learn by doing. If you look at the work of a painter in chronological order, you'll find that each painting builds on things that have been learned in previous ones. When there's something in a painting that works very well, you can usually find version 1 of it in a smaller form in some earlier painting."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might hackers benefit from adopting the creative processes of painters and other makers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think most makers work this way. Writers and architects seem to as well. Maybe it would be good for hackers to act more like painters and regularly start over from scratch, instead of continuing to work for years on one project and trying to incorporate all their later ideas as revisions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the learning processes of hackers and scientists differ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fact that hackers learn to hack by doing it is another sign of how different hacking is from the sciences. Scientists don't learn science by doing it, but by doing labs and problem sets. Scientists start out doing work that's perfect, in the sense that they're just trying to reproduce work someone else has already done for them. Eventually, they get to the point where they can do original work. In contrast, hackers, from the start, are doing original work; it's just very bad. So hackers start original and get good, while scientists start good and get original."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do painters enhance their skills through the study of master works?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Painters enhance their skills through the study of master works by learning from examples. For a painter, a museum serves as a reference library of techniques. For hundreds of years, it has been part of the traditional education of painters to copy the works of the great masters, because copying forces them to look closely at the way a painting is made."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do writers often develop their writing skills?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Writers often develop their writing skills by studying the work of others. For example, Benjamin Franklin learned to write by summarizing the points in the essays of Addison and Steele and then trying to reproduce them. Raymond Chandler did the same thing with detective stories."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the open-source movement impacted the learning process for new programmers compared to previous methods?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at good programsânot just at what they do, but the source code too. One of the less publicized benefits of the open-source movement is that it has made it easier to learn to program. When I learned to program, we had to rely mostly on examples in books. The one big chunk of code available then was Unix, but even this was not open source. Most of the people who read the source read it in illicit photocopies of John Lions' book, which, though written in 1977, was not allowed to be published until 1996."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the process of creating a painting illustrate the concept of gradual refinement and adaptation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another example we can take from painting is the way that paintings are created by gradual refinement. Paintings usually begin with a sketch. Gradually, the details get filled in. But it is not merely a process of filling in. Sometimes the original plans turn out to be mistaken. Countless paintings, when you look at them in X-rays, turn out to have limbs that have been moved or facial features that have been readjusted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the approach to programming benefit from lessons learned in painting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's a case where we can learn from painting. I think programming should work this way too. It's unrealistic to expect that the specifications for a program will be perfect. You're better off if you admit this up front and write programs in a way that allows specifications to change on the fly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the risk associated with making design decisions too early in the software development process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature optimization. I think we should be just as worried about premature designâdeciding too early what a program should do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What aspect of Leonardo's work ethic is compared to Michael Jordan's dedication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Leonardo's work ethic was not influenced by how closely he expected anyone to look at his paintings; he worked hard regardless. He was like Michael Jordanârelentless."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do unseen details play in creating impactful art, according to the example of Ginevra de Benci?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Relentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details become visible. When people walk by the portrait of Ginevra de Benci, their attention is often immediately arrested by it, even before they look at the label and notice that it says Leonardo da Vinci. All those unseen details combine to produce something that's just stunning, like a thousand barely audible voices all singing in tune."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What qualities contribute to the creation of great software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great software requires a fanatical devotion to beauty. If you look inside good software, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too. I'm not claiming I write great software, but I know that when it comes to code, I behave in a way that would make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way. It drives me crazy to see code that's badly indented or that uses ugly variable names."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What similarities exist between the creative processes in hacking and painting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In hacking, like painting, work comes in cycles. Sometimes you get excited about a new project and want to work sixteen hours a day on it. Other times, nothing seems interesting."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can managing different types of tasks help maintain productivity and prevent stagnation in creative work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To do good work, you have to take these cycles into account because they're affected by how you react to them. When you're driving a car with a manual transmission on a hill, you have to back off the clutch sometimes to avoid stalling. Backing off can likewise prevent ambition from stalling. In both painting and hacking, there are some tasks that are terrifyingly ambitious and others that are comfortingly routine. It's a good idea to save some easy tasks for moments when you would otherwise stall."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What aspects of debugging make it a uniquely enjoyable and straightforward experience in the context of hacking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In hacking, this can literally mean saving up bugs. I like debugging; it's the one time that hacking is as straightforward as people think it is. You have a totally constrained problem, and all you have to do is solve it. Your program is supposed to do x. Instead, it does y. Where does it go wrong? You know you're going to win in the end. It's as relaxing as painting a wall."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did collaboration typically work among painters in a workshop?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As far as I know, when painters worked together on a painting, they never worked on the same parts. It was common for the master to paint the principal figures and for assistants to paint the others and the background. However, you never had one guy painting over the work of another."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the recommended approach to collaboration in software development to prevent code from becoming unmanageable?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think this is the right model for collaboration in software too. Don't push it too far. When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four different people, none of whom really owns it, it will end up being like a common room. It will tend to feel bleak and abandoned and accumulate cruft. The right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces between them that are as carefully designed and, if possible, as articulated as programming languages."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is empathy important for hackers when developing software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like painting, most software is intended for a human audience. And so hackers, like painters, must have empathy to do really great work. You have to be able to see things from the user's point of view."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key factor that contributes to success in understanding others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It turns out that looking at things from other people's point of view is practically the secret of success. It doesn't necessarily mean being self-sacrificing. Far from it. Understanding how someone else sees things doesn't imply that you'll act in his interest; in some situationsâin war, for exampleâyou want to do exactly the opposite."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is understanding the audience important for creators?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most makers create things for a human audience. To engage an audience, you have to understand what they need. Nearly all the greatest paintings are paintings of people, for example, because people are what people are interested in."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role does empathy play in distinguishing a good hacker from a great one?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one. Some hackers are quite smart, but when it comes to empathy, they are practically solipsists. It's hard for such people to design great software because they can't see things from the user's point of view."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can someone's empathy be assessed in a technical conversation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to assess someone's empathy is to watch them explain a technical question to someone without a technical background. We probably all know people who, though otherwise smart, are just comically bad at this. If someone asks them at a dinner party what a programming language is, they'll say something like, \"Oh, a high-level language is what the compiler uses as input to generate object code.\" High-level language? Compiler? Object code? Someone who doesn't know what a programming language is obviously doesn't know what these things are, either."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What key principle should software developers keep in mind to improve user experience and usability?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Part of what software has to do is explain itself. So, to write good software, you have to understand how little users understand. They're going to walk up to the software with no preparation, and it had better do what they guess it will, because they're not going to read the manual. The best system I've ever seen in this respect was the original Macintosh in 1985. It did what software almost never does: it just worked."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for developers to maintain empathy for their users and readers when writing code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is important to have empathy not just for your users, but for your readers as well. It's in your interest because you'll be one of them. Many hackers have written a program only to find, upon returning to it six months later, that they have no idea how it works. I know several people who've sworn off Perl after such experiences."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of artistic pursuits like painting changed over time compared to modern activities like hacking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "While I admit that hacking doesn't seem as cool as painting now, we should remember that painting itself didn't seem as cool in its glory days as it does now."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Which artists or authors have significantly influenced their respective mediums, setting a high standard for future creators?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many artists and authors have significantly influenced their respective mediums, setting a high standard for future creators. For example, Shakespeare pushed the medium of playwriting so far that every playwright since has had to live in his shadow. Albrecht DÃ¼rer did the same thing with engraving, and Jane Austen with the novel."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What patterns can be observed in the evolution of new mediums and their exploration by people?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Over and over, we see the same pattern. A new medium appears, and people are so excited about it that they explore most of its possibilities in the first couple of generations. Hacking seems to be in this phase now."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might a company's policy against employees contributing to open-source projects impact its ability to attract top programming talent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A company's policy against employees contributing to open-source projects, even in their spare time, may significantly impact its ability to attract top programming talent. Many of the best programmers actively work on open-source projects, and such a restrictive policy could deter them from applying. As a result, the main effect of this policy may be to ensure that the company won't be able to hire any first-rate programmers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Viaweb approach decision-making when faced with competing alternatives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At Viaweb, if we couldn't decide between two alternatives, we'd ask, \"What would our competitors hate most?\" At one point, a competitor added a feature to their software that was basically useless, but since it was one of the few they had that we didn't, they made much of it in the trade press. We could have tried to explain that the feature was useless, but we decided it would annoy our competitor more if we just implemented it ourselves, so we hacked together our own version that afternoon."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should be the primary purpose of a programming language according to Abelson and Sussman's quote?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Programming languages should be designed to express algorithms, and only incidentally to tell computers how to execute them. A good programming language ought to be better for explaining software than English. You should only need comments when there is some kind of kludge you need to warn readers about, just as on a road there are only arrows on parts with unexpectedly sharp curves."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who contributed feedback or support during the drafting process of this work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I would like to thank Trevor Blackwell, Robert Morris, Dan Giffin, and Lisa Randall for reading drafts of this work, and to Henry Leitner and Larry Finkelstein for inviting me to speak."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some common misconceptions people have about using Lisp as a programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for not using it. The standard excuse, back when C was the default language, was that Lisp was too slow. Now that Lisp dialects are among the fastest programming languages available, this misconception persists, along with others such as the belief that Lisp is only suitable for artificial intelligence or that its syntax is too complex for practical use."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the increasing popularity of certain programming languages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Popularity is always self-perpetuating, but it's especially so in programming languages. More libraries get written for popular languages, which makes them still more popular. Programs often have to work with existing programs, and this is easier if they're written in the same language, so languages spread from program to program like a virus. Additionally, managers prefer popular languages because they give them more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the long-term success of Java as a programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I predict a similar fate for Java. People sometimes send me mail saying, \"How can you say that Java won't turn out to be a successful language? It's already a successful language.\" And I admit that it is, if you measure success by shelf space taken up by books on it (particularly individual books on it) or by the number of undergrads who believe they have to learn it to get a job. When I say Java won't turn out to be a successful language, I mean something more specific: that Java will turn out to be an evolutionary dead end, like Cobol."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to consider the evolutionary relationships of programming languages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is important to consider the evolutionary relationships of programming languages because it helps us understand where a language fits within the broader context of programming language development. My point here is not to dis Java, but to raise the issue of evolutionary trees and get people asking, \"Where on the tree is language X?\" The reason to ask this question isn't just so that our ghosts can say, \"In a hundred years, I told you so.\" It's because staying close to the main branches is a useful heuristic for finding languages that will be good to program in now."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the evolution of languages differ from the evolution of species?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The evolution of languages differs from the evolution of species because branches can converge. The Fortran branch, for example, seems to be merging with the descendants of Algol. In theory, this is possible for species too, but it's not likely to have happened to anything bigger than a cell."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the convergence of programming languages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Convergence is more likely for languages partly because the space of possibilities is smaller, and partly because mutations are not random. Language designers deliberately incorporate ideas from other languages."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can language designers use the concept of \"staying on a main branch\" to influence the evolution of programming languages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's especially useful for language designers to think about where the evolution of programming languages is likely to lead because they can steer accordingly. In that case, \"staying on a main branch\" becomes more than a way to choose a good language; it becomes a heuristic for making the right decisions about language design."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two main components that comprise a programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Any programming language can be divided into two parts: some set of fundamental operators that play the role of axioms, and the rest of the language, which could, in principle, be written in terms of these fundamental operators."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do mathematicians value having a limited number of well-chosen axioms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's important not just that the axioms be well-chosen, but that there be few of them. Mathematicians have always felt this way about axiomsâthe fewer, the betterâand I think they're onto something."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do programming languages evolve at a slower rate compared to technological advancements in fields like transportation or communications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Languages evolve slowly because they're not really technologies; they are notation. A program is a formal description of the problem you want a computer to solve for you. Thus, the rate of evolution in programming languages is more akin to the rate of evolution in mathematical notation than, say, transportation or communications. Mathematical notation does evolve, but not with the giant leaps you see in technology."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What types of problems in computing require high processing speeds due to their inherent demands?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some applications will still demand speed. Some of the problems we want to solve with computers are created by computers; for example, the rate at which you have to process video images depends on the rate at which another computer can generate them. There is another class of problems that inherently have an unlimited capacity to soak up cycles: image rendering, cryptography, and simulations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How is the efficiency of programming languages affected by the increasing speed of modern computers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If some applications can be increasingly inefficient while others continue to demand all the speed the hardware can deliver, faster computers will mean that languages have to cover an ever wider range of efficiencies. We've seen this happening already. Current implementations of some popular new languages are shockingly wasteful by the standards of previous decades."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do advancements in technology change perceptions of efficiency and wastefulness across generations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As technologies improve, each generation can do things that the previous generation would have considered wasteful. People thirty years ago would be astonished at how casually we make long-distance phone calls. People a hundred years ago would be even more astonished that a package would one day travel from Boston to New York via Memphis."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has early experience with limited computer resources influenced your perspective on software efficiency?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I learned to program when computer power was scarce. I can remember taking all the spaces out of my Basic programs so they would fit into the memory of a 4K TRS-80. The thought of all this stupendously inefficient software burning up cycles doing the same thing over and over seems kind of gross to me. But I think my intuitions here are wrong. I'm like someone who grew up poor and can't bear to spend money even for something important, like going to the doctor."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can we balance efficiency and convenience in language design considering our inherent desire for speed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The desire for speed is so deeply ingrained in us, with our puny computers, that it will take a conscious effort to overcome it. In language design, we should be consciously seeking out situations where we can trade efficiency for even the smallest increase in convenience."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach can be taken to improve the handling of data types in programming?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The right way to solve that problem, I think, is to separate the meaning of a program from the implementation details. Instead of having both lists and strings, have just lists, with some way to give the compiler optimization advice that will allow it to lay out strings as contiguous bytes if necessary."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is micromanaging program speed generally unnecessary in most cases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since speed doesn't matter in most parts of a program, you won't ordinarily need to bother with this sort of micromanagement. This will be more and more true as computers get faster."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does reducing the emphasis on implementation in program specifications enhance flexibility?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reducing the emphasis on implementation in program specifications should also make programs more flexible. Specifications change while a program is being written, and this is not only inevitable but desirable."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the origin of the word \"essay\" and how does it relate to the process of writing in software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The word \"essay\" comes from the French verb \"essayer,\" which means \"to try.\" An essay, in the original sense, is something you write to try to figure something out. This happens in software too. I think some of the best programs were essays, in the sense that the authors didn't know when they started exactly what they were trying to write."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What will future programmers prioritize in a programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What programmers in a hundred years will be looking for, most of all, is a language where you can throw together an unbelievably inefficient version 1 of a program with the least possible effort. At least, that's how we'd describe it in present-day terms. What they'll say is that they want a language that's easy to program in."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is considered the real inefficiency in programming, according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Inefficient software isn't gross. What's gross is a language that makes programmers do needless work. Wasting programmer time is the true inefficiency, not wasting machine time. This will become ever more clear as computers get faster."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some limitations of the original Lisp programming language as described by McCarthy in 1960?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Lisp that McCarthy described in 1960, for example, didn't have numbers. Logically, you don't need to have a separate notion of numbers because you can represent them as lists: the integer n could be represented as a list of n elements. You can do math this way; it's just unbearably inefficient."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the proposed approach to defining the core language for numerical calculations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To clarify, I am not proposing that all numerical calculations would actually be carried out using lists. I am proposing that the core language, prior to any additional notations about implementation, be defined this way. In practice, any program that wanted to do any amount of math would probably represent numbers in binary, but this would be an optimization, not part of the core language semantics."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the impact of having multiple software layers between an application and hardware on performance and flexibility?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Having multiple software layers between an application and the hardware can significantly impact performance and flexibility. Another way to burn up cycles is to have many layers of software between the application and the hardware. This too is a trend we see happening already: many recent languages are compiled into bytecode. Bill Woods once told me that, as a rule of thumb, each layer of interpretation costs a factor of 10 in speed. This extra cost buys you flexibility."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the characteristics and implications of the first version of Arc as a metacircular interpreter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The very first version of Arc was an extreme case of this sort of multi-level slowness, with corresponding benefits. It was a classic \"metacircular\" interpreter written on top of Common Lisp, with a definite family resemblance to the eval function defined in McCarthy's original Lisp paper. The whole thing was only a couple of hundred lines of code, so it was very easy to understand and change. The Common Lisp we used, CLisp, itself runs on top of a bytecode interpreter. So here we had two levels of interpretation, one of them (the top one) shockingly inefficient, and the language was usable. Barely usable, I admit, but usable."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of using a layered approach in software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Writing software as multiple layers is a powerful technique even within applications. Bottom-up programming means writing a program as a series of layers, each of which serves as a language for the one above. This approach tends to yield smaller, more flexible programs. It's also the best route to that holy grail, reusability. A language is, by definition, reusable. The more of your application you can push down into a language for writing that type of application, the more of your software will be reusable."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the reusability of software beyond its object-oriented design?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Somehow the idea of reusability got attached to object-oriented programming in the 1980s, and no amount of evidence to the contrary seems to be able to shake it free. But although some object-oriented software is reusable, what makes it reusable is its bottom-upness, not its object-orientedness. Consider libraries: they're reusable because they're language-agnostic, whether they're written in an object-oriented style or not."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is parallel computation considered a significant aspect of future technological advancements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Parallel computation is considered a significant aspect of future technological advancements because it represents a crucial shift in how we process information. This approach allows for the simultaneous execution of multiple computations, which can lead to faster processing times and more efficient use of resources. As technology continues to evolve, the need for parallel computation will only increase, making it a key component in the development of advanced systems and applications."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the concept of parallel computation influenced programming practices and chip design over the past two decades?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The future of parallel computation has been a topic of discussion for at least 20 years, and while it may not have significantly affected programming practices yet, it is beginning to influence chip design. Chip designers must consider parallel computation, as do those writing systems software for multi-CPU computers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How might the role of parallelism evolve in programming over the next century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The real question is, how far up the ladder of abstraction will parallelism go? In a hundred years, will it affect even application programmers? Or will it be something that compiler writers think about, but which is usually invisible in the source code of applications?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the anticipated future of parallelism in programming according to the author's predictions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One thing that does seem likely is that most opportunities for parallelism will be wasted. This is a special case of my more general prediction that most of the extra computer power we're given will go to waste. I expect that, as with the stupendous speed of the underlying hardware, parallelism will be something that is available if you ask for it explicitly, but ordinarily not used. This implies that the kind of parallelism we have in a hundred years will not, except in special applications, be massive parallelism. I expect for ordinary programmers it will be more like being able to fork off processes that all end up running in parallel."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When is it appropriate to consider specific implementations of data structures and parallel computation in the development of a program?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When considering specific implementations of data structures and parallel computation in the development of a program, it is appropriate to do so fairly late in the life of the program, when you try to optimize it. Version 1s will ordinarily ignore any advantages to be gained from parallel computation, just as they will ignore advantages to be gained from specific representations of data."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the future outlook for programming languages in terms of efficiency and optimization over the next hundred years?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There may be only a few widely-used languages in a hundred years. Part of the reason I say this is optimism: it seems that, if you did a really good job, you could make a language that was ideal for writing a slow version 1, and yet with the right optimization advice to the compiler, would also yield very fast code when necessary. So, since I'm optimistic, I'm going to predict that despite the huge gap they'll have between acceptable and maximal efficiency, programmers in a hundred years will have languages that can span most of it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the role of profilers expected to become more important as the performance gap in applications increases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As this gap widens, profilers will become increasingly important. Little attention is paid to profiling now. Many people still seem to believe that the way to get fast applications is to write compilers that generate fast code. As the gap between acceptable and maximal performance widens, it will become increasingly clear that the way to get fast applications is to have a good guide from one to the other."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the future of domain-specific languages compared to general-purpose languages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I say there may only be a few languages, I'm not including domain-specific \"little languages.\" I think such embedded languages are a great idea, and I expect them to proliferate. But I expect them to be written as thin enough skins that users can see the general-purpose language underneath."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the abilities of teachers compared to those they educate?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not true that those who can't do, teach (some of the best hackers I know are professors), but it is true that there are a lot of things that those who teach can't do."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What limitations exist in the relationship between research work and effective programming language development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Though the situation is better in the sciences, the overlap between the kind of work you're allowed to do and the kind of work that yields good languages is distressingly small. Olin Shivers has grumbled eloquently about this. For example, types seem to be an inexhaustible source of research papers, despite the fact that static typing seems to preclude true macrosâwithout which, in my opinion, no language is worth using."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What shift is occurring in the development of programming languages according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The trend is not merely toward languages being developed as open-source projects rather than \"research,\" but toward languages being designed by the application programmers who need to use them, rather than by compiler writers. This seems to be a good trend, and I expect it to continue."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How feasible is it to create a language today that would remain appealing to users in a hundred years?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Unlike physics in a hundred years, which is almost necessarily impossible to predict, I think it may be possible, in principle, to design a language now that would appeal to users in a hundred years."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is one approach to designing a programming language that disregards current technological limitations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One way to design a language is to just write down the program you'd like to be able to write, regardless of whether there is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it. When you do this, you can assume unlimited resources. It seems like we ought to be able to imagine unlimited resources as well today as in a hundred years."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do existing programming language influences affect our ability to express ideas with minimal effort?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Our ability to express ideas with minimal effort is significantly influenced by the programming languages we are accustomed to. Such influence can be so pervasive that it takes a great effort to overcome it. You'd think it would be obvious to creatures as lazy as us how to express a program with the least effort. In fact, our ideas about what's possible tend to be so limited by these existing languages that they hinder our creativity and efficiency."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What principle should guide language design to improve program writing efficiency?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The principle that should guide language design to improve program writing efficiency is to consider the program as an approximation for how much work it is to write. Not the length in characters, of course, but the length in distinct syntactic elementsâbasically, the size of the parse tree. It may not be quite true that the shortest program is the least work to write, but it's close enough that you're better off aiming for the solid target of brevity than the fuzzy, nearby one of least work. Then the algorithm for language design becomes: look at a program and ask, is there any way to write this that's shorter?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges might arise when developing software for future technologies that are not yet conceived?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In practice, writing programs in an imaginary hundred-year language will work to varying degrees depending on how close you are to the core. Sort routines you can write now. However, it would be hard to predict what kinds of libraries might be needed in a hundred years. Presumably, many libraries will be for domains that don't even exist yet. If SETI@home works, for example, we'll need libraries for communicating with aliens. Unless, of course, they are sufficiently advanced that they already communicate in XML."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What year is suggested as the time when the core language was mostly designed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At the other extreme, I think you might be able to design the core language today. In fact, some might argue that it was already mostly designed in 1958."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Would talented programmers from earlier eras be able to adapt to modern programming languages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think so. Some of the less imaginative ones, who had artifacts of early languages built into their ideas of what a program was, might have had trouble. How can you manipulate data without doing pointer arithmetic? How can you implement flow charts without gotos? But I think the smartest programmers would have had no trouble making the most of present-day languages if they'd had them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How could the hundred-year language be utilized in modern software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If we had the hundred-year language now, it would at least make a great pseudocode. What about using it to write software? Since the hundred-year language would need to generate fast code for some applications, presumably it could generate code efficient enough to run acceptably well on our hardware. We might have to give more optimization advice than users in a hundred years, but it still might be a net win."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of designing a hundred-year programming language today?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now we have two ideas that, if you combine them, suggest interesting possibilities: (1) the hundred-year language could, in principle, be designed today, and (2) such a language, if it existed, might be good to program in today. When you see these ideas laid out like that, it's hard not to think, why not try writing the hundred-year language now?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of having a long-term vision in language design, according to the analogy with learning to drive?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you're working on language design, I think it is good to have such a target and to keep it consciously in mind. When you learn to drive, one of the principles they teach you is to align the car not by lining up the hood with the stripes painted on the road, but by aiming at some point in the distance. Even if all you care about is what happens in the next ten feet, this is the right answer. I think we can and should do the same thing with programming languages."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What programming language was the first to treat declarations as optimization advice rather than altering program meaning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I believe Lisp Machine Lisp was the first language to embody the principle that declarations (except those of dynamic variables) were merely optimization advice and would not change the meaning of a correct program. Common Lisp seems to have been the first to state this explicitly."}]}

Everyone in the school knew exactly how popular everyone else was, including us."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What experiences contributed to your rise in popularity during high school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My stock gradually rose during high school.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between intelligence and social popularity according to the experiences of self-identified nerds?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tell the same story: there is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between being a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to lead to social unpopularity among those who identify as nerds."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors were prioritized over intelligence among students in the schools described?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the schools I went to, being smart just didn't matter much. Kids didn't admire it or despise it. All other things being equal, they would have preferred to be on the smart side of average rather than the dumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say, physical appearance, charisma, or athletic ability."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the emotional impacts of being unpopular in school, according to personal experiences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed at him. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable; some of them are so miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that I didn't want to be popular would have seemed like telling someone dying of thirst in a desert that he didn't want a glass of water. Of course, I wanted to be popular."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the author's primary aspiration beyond academic success?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But in fact, I didn't, not enough. There was something else I wanted more: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though that counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write well, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to make great things."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What realization did the author come to regarding the value of intelligence versus popularity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At the time, I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them against one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart was more important. If someone had offered me the chance to be the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn't have taken it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Would many kids prefer to be socially accepted over being perceived as highly intelligent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Much as they suffer from their unpopularity, I don't think many nerds would. To them, the thought of average intelligence is unbearable. But most kids would take that deal. For half of them, it would be a step up. Even for someone in the eightieth percentile (assuming, as everyone seemed to then, that intelligence is a scalar), who wouldn't drop thirty points in exchange for being loved and admired by everyone?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What internal conflict do nerds face in the context of American secondary schools?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nerds serve two masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even more to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in your spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary school."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do teenagers place significant importance on their clothing and appearance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Teenagers pay a great deal of attention to clothes. They don't consciously dress to be popular; they dress to look good. But to whom? To the other kids. Other kids' opinions become their definition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everything they do, right down to the way they walk. And so, every effort they make to do things \"right\" is also, consciously or not, an effort to be more popular."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to a person's popularity beyond inherent qualities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nerds don't realize this. They don't realize that it takes work to be popular. In general, people outside some very demanding fields don't realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though often unconscious) effort. For example, most people seem to consider the ability to draw as some kind of innate quality, like being tall. In fact, most people who \"can draw\" like drawing and have spent many hours doing it; that's why they're good at it. Likewise, being popular isn't just something you are or you aren't, but something you make yourself."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are nerds often considered unpopular among their peers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about. Their attention is drawn to books or the natural world, not fashions and parties. They're like someone trying to play soccer while balancing a glass of water on their head. Other players who can focus their whole attention on the game beat them effortlessly and wonder why they seem so incapable."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do the upbringing and social training of nerds and popular kids differ in terms of their priorities and skills?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even if nerds cared as much as other kids about popularity, being popular would be more work for them. The popular kids learned to be popular and to want to be popular, the same way the nerds learned to be smart and to want to be smart: from their parents. While the nerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kids were being trained to please."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the perception of someone as a \"nerd\" in social contexts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So far, I've been finessing the relationship between smart and nerd, using them as if they were interchangeable. In fact, it's only the context that makes them so. A nerd is someone who isn't socially adept enough. But \"enough\" depends on where you are. In a typical American school, standards for coolness are so high (or at least, so specific) that you don't have to be especially awkward to look awkward by comparison."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the social challenges faced by smart kids during adolescence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires. Unless they also happen to be good-looking, natural athletes, or siblings of popular kids, they'll tend to become nerds. And that's why smart people's lives are worst between, say, the ages of eleven and seventeen. Life at that age revolves far more around popularity than before or after."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the influence of parents on children's lives change as they grow older?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Before that, kids' lives are dominated by their parents, not by other kids.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do children's social dynamics change around the age of eleven?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Around the age of eleven, though, kids seem to start treating their family as a day job. They create a new world among themselves, and standing in this world is what matters, not standing in their family. Indeed, being in trouble in their family can win them points in the world they care about."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What message did the author feel was missed in the book they read in school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like a lot of American kids, I read this book in school. Presumably, it was not a coincidence. Presumably, someone wanted to point out to us that we were savages and that we had made ourselves a cruel and stupid world. This was too subtle for me. While the book seemed entirely believable, I didn't get the additional message. I wish they had just told us outright that we were savages and our world was stupid."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does unpopularity affect the social experiences of nerds in school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nerds would find their unpopularity more bearable if it merely caused them to be ignored. Unfortunately, to be unpopular in school is to be actively persecuted."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role do alliances and common enemies play in the dynamics of popularity among children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it's part of the mechanism of popularity. Popularity is only partially about individual attractiveness; it's much more about alliances. To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people closer than a common enemy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do groups tend to bully more effectively than individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times at home, you can create an enemy if there isn't a real one. By singling out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the hierarchy creates bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsider makes them all insiders. This is why the worst cases of bullying happen with groups. Ask any nerd: you get much worse treatment from a group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic."}]}

They don't actually hate you; they just need something to chase."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who tends to be the primary perpetrators of bullying against nerds in schools?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because they're at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target for the entire school. If I remember correctly, the most popular kids don't persecute nerds; they don't need to stoop to such things. Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous middle classes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the paragraph suggest about the dynamics of popularity and social groups in a cafeteria setting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The trouble is, there are a lot of them. The distribution of popularity is not a pyramid but tapers at the bottom like a pear. The least popular group is quite small; I believe we were the only D table in our cafeteria map.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does social dynamics in high school influence friendships and interactions with unpopular peers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids, one loses points by being close to them. A woman I know says that in high school she liked nerds but was afraid to be seen talking to them because the other girls would make fun of her. Unpopularity is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still ostracize them in self-defense."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do smart students often experience unhappiness during middle and high school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's no wonder, then, that smart kids tend to be unhappy in middle school and high school. Their other interests leave them little attention to spare for popularity, and since popularity resembles a zero-sum game, this, in turn, makes them targets for the whole school. And the strange thing is, this nightmare scenario happens without any conscious malice, merely because of the shape of the situation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What age range do many people consider the most challenging period of adolescence?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For me, the worst stretch was junior high, when kid culture was new and harsh, and the specialization that would later gradually separate the smarter kids had barely begun.

They know, in the abstract, that kids are monstrously cruel to one another, just as we know in the abstract that people get tortured in poorer countries.

The most important thing was to stay on the premises. While there, the authorities fed you, prevented overt violence, and made some effort to teach you something. But beyond that, they didn't want to have too much to do with the kids. Like prison wardens, the teachers mostly left us to ourselves. And, like prisoners, the culture we created was barbaric."}]}

That's what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch all lack. The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect.

I've read a lot of history, and I have not seen a single reference to this supposedly universal fact before the twentieth century. Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance seem to have been cheerful and eager. They got in fights and played tricks on one another, of course (Michelangelo had his nose broken by a bully), but they weren't crazy."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was the role of teenagers in society before industrialization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society. In pre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort or another, whether in shops, on farms, or even on warships. They weren't left to create their own societies; they were junior members of adult societies."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of adult expertise among teenagers changed over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Teenagers seem to have respected adults more then, because the adults were the visible experts in the skills they were trying to learn.

A rookie on a football team doesn't resent the skill of the veteran; he hopes to be like him one day and is happy to have the chance to learn from him.

And I lost more than books. I mistrusted words like \"character\" and \"integrity\" because they had been so debased by adults. As they were used then, these words all seemed to mean the same thing: obedience. The kids who got praised for these qualities tended to be, at best, dull-witted prize bulls, and at worst, facile schmoozers. If that was what character and integrity were, I wanted no part of them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was a key misunderstanding the author had about the meaning of the word \"tact\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The word I most misunderstood was \"tact.\" As used by adults, it seemed to mean keeping your mouth shut. I assumed it was derived from the same root as \"tacit\" and \"taciturn,\" and that it literally meant being quiet. I vowed that I would never be tactful; they were never going to shut me up. In fact, it's derived from the same root as \"tactile,\" and what it means is to have a deft touch. Tactful is the opposite of clumsy. I don't think I learned this until college."}]}

It was something to do together, and because the drugs were illegal, it was a shared badge of rebellion."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates teenagers to experiment with drugs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Using drugs was rebellion.

Nerds aren't losers; they're just playing a different gameâone that is much closer to the one played in the real world. Successful adults recognize this, and it's hard to find accomplished individuals today who don't claim to have been nerds in high school."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What perspective should students adopt regarding their experiences in school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's important for students to realize, too, that school is not life.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the origins of Bayesian spam filtering in the field of text classification?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Spam filtering is a subset of text classification, which is a well-established field. However, the first papers about Bayesian spam filtering per se seem to have been two given at the same conference in 1998: one by Pantel and Lin [2], and another by a group from Microsoft Research [3]."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of varying performance results in Bayesian spam filters for different users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I tried writing a Bayesian spam filter, it caught 99.5% of spam with less than 0.03% false positives. It's always alarming when two people trying the same experiment get widely divergent results. It's especially alarming here because those two sets of numbers might yield opposite conclusions. Different users have different requirements, but I think for many people, a filtering rate of 92% with 1.16% false positives means that filtering is not an acceptable solution, whereas 99.5% with less than 0.03% false positives means that it is."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors might explain the discrepancies in the results between this study and Pantel and Lin's findings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So why did we get such different numbers? I haven't tried to reproduce Pantel and Lin's results, but from reading the paper, I see five things that probably account for the difference."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the size of the training dataset affect the performance evaluation of a spam filter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One reason is simply that they trained their filter on very little data: 160 spam and 466 non-spam emails. Filter performance should still be climbing with data sets that small. So their numbers may not even be an accurate measure of the performance of their algorithm, let alone of Bayesian spam filtering in general."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What crucial lesson did the author learn about data while developing spam filters?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I think the most important difference is probably that they ignored message headers. To anyone who has worked on spam filters, this will seem a perverse decision. And yet in the very first filters I tried writing, I ignored the headers too. Why? Because I wanted to keep the problem neat. I didn't know much about mail headers then, and they seemed to me full of random stuff. There is a lesson here for filter writers: don't ignore data. You'd think this lesson would be too obvious to mention, but I've had to learn it several times."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach did Pantel and Lin use to handle variations of words in their analysis, and what concern did it raise?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Third, Pantel and Lin stemmed the tokens, meaning they reduced, e.g., both \"mailing\" and \"mailed\" to the root \"mail.\" They may have felt they were forced to do this due to the small size of their corpus, but if so, this is a kind of premature optimization."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the difference in token usage affect the effectiveness of spam detection algorithms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fourth, they calculated probabilities differently. They used all the tokens, whereas I only use the 15 most significant. If you use all the tokens, you'll tend to miss longer spams, the type where someone tells you their life story up to the point where they got rich from some multilevel marketing scheme. Such an algorithm would be easy for spammers to spoof: just add a big chunk of random text to counterbalance the spam terms."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to approach spam filtering differently than standard text classification?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't think it's a good idea to treat spam filtering as a straight text classification problem. You can use text classification techniques, but solutions can and should reflect the fact that the text is email, and spam in particular. Email is not just text; it has structure. Spam filtering is not just classification because false positives are so much worse than false negatives that you should treat them as a different kind of error. And the source of error is not just random variation, but a live human spammer working actively to defeat your filter."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is an example of a system that effectively filters spam without being explicitly designed for that purpose?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is the counterexample to the design principle I just mentioned. It's a straightforward text classifier, but such a stunningly effective one that it manages to filter spam almost perfectly without even knowing that's what it's doing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivated the author to explore beyond single-word filtering in CRM114?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Once I understood how CRM114 worked, it seemed inevitable that I would eventually have to move from filtering based on single words to an approach like this. But first, I thought, I'll see how far I can get with single words. And the answer is, surprisingly far."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advancements have you made in spam filtering techniques compared to existing methods?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mostly, I've been working on smarter tokenization. On current spam, I've been able to achieve filtering rates that approach CRM114's. These techniques are mostly orthogonal to Bill's; an optimal solution might incorporate both."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the definition of a token in \"A Plan for Spam\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"A Plan for Spam\" uses a very simple definition of a token. Letters, digits, dashes, apostrophes, and dollar signs are constituent characters, and everything else is a token separator. I also ignored case."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How are tokens in email headers and URLs processed for identification?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tokens that occur within the To, From, Subject, and Return-Path lines, or within URLs, get marked accordingly. For example, \"foo\" in the Subject line becomes \"Subject*foo.\" (The asterisk could be any character you don't allow as a constituent.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the position of a word like \"free\" affect its spam probability in filters?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Such measures increase the filter's vocabulary, which makes it more discriminating. For example, in the current filter, \"free\" in the Subject line has a spam probability of 98%, whereas the same token in the body has a spam probability of only 65%."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the various frequencies of the term \"free\" in the provided dataset?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Subject*FREE      0.9999 free!!            0.9999 To*free           0.9998 Subject*free      0.9782 free!             0.9199 Free              0.9198 Url*free          0.9091 FREE              0.8747 From*free         0.7636 free              0.6546"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How many tokens did the current spam filter recognize compared to the Plan for Spam filter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the Plan for Spam filter, all these tokens would have had the same probability, 0.7602. That filter recognized about 23,000 tokens, while the current one recognizes about 187,000 tokens."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the concept of degeneration in token matching, and how does it affect probability assignment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One solution to this is what I call degeneration. If you can't find an exact match for a token, treat it as if it were a less specific version. I consider terminal exclamation points, uppercase letters, and occurrences in one of the five marked contexts as making a token more specific. For example, if I don't find a probability for \"Subject*free!\", I look for probabilities for \"Subject*free\", \"free!\", and \"free\", and take whichever one is farthest from 0.5."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the repeated emphasis on \"free\" suggest about the item being offered?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The repeated emphasis on \"free\" suggests that the item being offered is intended to attract attention and entice potential customers. The use of \"free\" in various forms and capitalizations indicates a strong promotional strategy, highlighting the value proposition of no cost associated with the item. This repetition reinforces the idea that the item is accessible and appealing to a wide audience."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the capitalization of verbs affect their likelihood of being classified as spam?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you do this, be sure to consider versions with initial caps as well as all uppercase and all lowercase. Spams tend to have more sentences in imperative mood, and in those, the first word is a verb. So verbs with initial caps have higher spam probabilities than they would in all lowercase. In my filter, the spam probability of \"Act\" is 98%, and for \"act,\" it is only 62%."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does expanding a filter's vocabulary affect word counting in text analysis?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you increase your filter's vocabulary, you can end up counting the same word multiple times, according to your old definition of \"same.\" Logically, they're not the same token anymore. But if this still bothers you, let me add from experience that the words you seem to be counting multiple times tend to be exactly the ones you'd want to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can a larger vocabulary impact the effectiveness of spam detection in email filtering?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A larger vocabulary can significantly impact the effectiveness of spam detection in email filtering. When examining incoming mail, a larger vocabulary allows for the identification of more interesting tokensâthose with probabilities far from 0.5. I use the 15 most interesting tokens to determine if an email is spam. However, using a fixed number can lead to issues. If many tokens are maximally interesting, the final decision may be influenced by a random factor that determines the ordering of equally interesting tokens. One way to address this is to prioritize some tokens as more interesting than others."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can two tokens with vastly different frequencies in spam and legitimate corpora have the same spam probability?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, the token \"dalco\" occurs 3 times in my spam corpus and never in my legitimate corpus. The token \"Url*optmails\" (meaning \"optmails\" within a URL) occurs 1,223 times. And yet, as I used to calculate probabilities for tokens, both would have the same spam probability, the threshold of 0.99."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What approach does Steven Hauser suggest for improving the effectiveness of a statistical spam filter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another possibility would be to consider not just 15 tokens, but all the tokens over a certain threshold of interestingness. Steven Hauser does this in his statistical spam filter. If you use a threshold, make it very high, or spammers could spoof you by packing messages with more innocent words."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the recommended strategy for handling HTML when filtering content?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finally, what should one do about HTML? I've tried the whole spectrum of options, from ignoring it to parsing it all. Ignoring HTML is a bad idea because it's full of useful spam signs. But if you parse it all, your filter might degenerate into a mere HTML recognizer. The most effective approach seems to be the middle course: to notice some tokens but not others. I look at <a>, <img>, and <font> tags and ignore the rest. Links and images you should certainly look at because they contain URLs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might it not be necessary to invest significant time in improving HTML handling for spam filtering?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I could probably be smarter about dealing with HTML, but I don't think it's worth putting a lot of time into this. Spams full of HTML are easy to filter. The smarter spammers already avoid it. So performance in the future should not depend much on how you deal with HTML."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics might future spam messages exhibit?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fourth spam was what I call a spam-of-the-future because this is what I expect spam to evolve into: some completely neutral text followed by a URL. In this case, it was from someone saying they had finally finished their homepage and would I go look at it. (The page was, of course, an ad for a porn site.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the impact of false positives in statistical spam filters?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In a way, it's a relief to get some false positives. When I wrote \"A Plan for Spam,\" I hadn't had any, and I didn't know what they'd be like. Now that I've had a few, I'm relieved to find they're not as bad as I feared. False positives yielded by statistical filters turn out to be emails that sound a lot like spam, and these tend to be the ones you would least mind missing [9]."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What led to the classification of certain newsletters as false positives in email filtering?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Two of the false positives were newsletters from companies I've bought things from. I never asked to receive them, so arguably they were spam, but I count them as false positives because I hadn't been deleting them as spam before. The reason the filters caught them was that both companies, in January, switched to commercial email senders instead of sending the emails from their own servers, and both the headers and the bodies became much spammier."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What issue arose from making tokens case sensitive in the Plan for Spam filter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The third false positive was a bad one, though. It was from someone in Egypt and was written in all uppercase. This was a direct result of making tokens case sensitive; the Plan for Spam filter wouldn't have caught it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do effective filters face in accurately categorizing emails?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's hard to say what the overall false positive rate is because we're up in the noise, statistically. Anyone who has worked on filters (at least, effective filters) will be aware of this problem. With some emails, it's hard to say whether they're spam or not, and these are the ones you end up looking at when you get filters really tight. For example, so far the filter has caught two emails that were sent to my address because of a typo and one sent to me in the belief that I was someone else. Arguably, these are neither my spam nor my non-spam mail."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the false positive rate of your email filtering system based on your experience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not counting these, I've had a total of five false positives so far, out of about 7,740 legitimate emails, resulting in a rate of 0.06%. The other two were a notice that something I bought was back-ordered and a party reminder from Evite."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What issues contributed to the false positives identified in the email filter?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The five false positives on my bug list include an email from Egypt that was flagged because the uppercase text made it appear to the filter as Nigerian spam. This is indeed a bug. Similar to HTML, emails that are entirely in uppercase can conceptually lead to misclassification."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of profiling in optimizing code performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Profiling is crucial in optimizing code performance because it allows developers to identify the specific areas where their code is slow. Instead of guessing where the bottlenecks are, which often leads to incorrect assumptions, profiling provides concrete data that highlights the actual performance issues. This targeted approach enables more effective optimizations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should you focus on when trying to improve the efficiency of your code in filtering spam?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Focus on where your code is slow and fix that. In filtering, this translates to: look at the spams you miss and figure out what you could have done to catch them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the types of spam emails that are difficult to filter out?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two kinds of spam that I currently have trouble with. One is the type that pretends to be an email from a woman inviting you to chat with her or see her profile on a dating site. These get through because they're the one type of sales pitch you can make without using sales talk. They use the same vocabulary as ordinary email."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What type of spam emails do you find difficult to filter out, and why?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other kind of spam I have trouble filtering is from companies in, e.g., Bulgaria, offering contract programming services. These get through because I'm a programmer too, and the spam is full of the same words as my real mail."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What aspects of personal ads differentiate them from legitimate emails?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will probably focus on the personal ad type first. I think if I look closer, I'll be able to find statistical differences between these and my real mail. The style of writing is certainly different, though it may take multiword filtering to catch that. Also, I notice they tend to repeat the URL, and someone including a URL in legitimate mail wouldn't do that [11]."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of network-level filters in combating spam?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Network-level filters won't be completely useless. They may be enough to kill all the \"opt-in\" spam, meaning spam from companies like Virtumundo and Equalamail, who claim that they're really running opt-in lists. You can filter those based just on the headers, no matter what they say in the body. However, anyone willing to falsify headers or use open relays, presumably including most porn spammers, should be able to get some messages past network-level filters if they want to. (By no means the message they'd like to send though, which is something.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What features make personalized email filters more effective in identifying spam?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The kind of filters I'm optimistic about are ones that calculate probabilities based on each individual user's mail. These can be much more effective, not only in avoiding false positives but also in filtering spam. For example, finding the recipient's email address base-64 encoded anywhere in a message is a very good spam indicator."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What benefit do individual filters provide in combating spam?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The real advantage of individual filters is that they'll all be different. If everyone's filters have different probabilities, it will make the spammers' optimization loop, what programmers would call their edit-compile-test cycle, appallingly slow. Instead of just tweaking a spam until it gets through a copy of some filter they have on their desktop, they'll have to do a test mailing for each tweak. It would be like programming in a language without an interactive toplevel, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the overall prior ratio of spam to non-spam considered ineffective for prediction in this context?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The second assumption I made was that the proportion of spam in my incoming mail fluctuated so much from day to day (indeed, from hour to hour) that the overall prior ratio seemed worthless as a predictor. If you assume that P(spam) and P(nonspam) are both 0.5, they cancel out, and you can remove them from the formula."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can incorporating prior probabilities enhance Bayesian filtering performance in varying spam-to-nonspam ratios?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you are doing Bayesian filtering in a situation where the ratio of spam to nonspam is consistently very high or (especially) very low, you could probably improve filter performance by incorporating prior probabilities. To do this correctly, you would have to track ratios by time of day, because spam and legitimate mail volume both have distinct daily patterns."}]}

Many of the false positives caused by filters will be near-spams that you wouldn't mind missing, whereas false positives caused by blacklists will typically be just mail from people who chose the wrong ISP. In both cases, you catch mail that's near spam, but for blacklists, nearness is physical, while for filters, it's textual."}]}

Finding words this way that weren't visible in the original text would, in itself, be evidence of spam."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do spam messages differ from regular emails in terms of content repetition, and what filtering strategy is being considered to address potential false positives?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In general, spam messages are more repetitive than regular emails. They want to pound that message home. I currently don't allow duplicates in the top 15 tokens because you could get a false positive if the sender happens to use some bad word multiple times. (In my current filter, \"dick\" has a spam probability of .9999, but it's also a name.)

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes the goals and qualities of design and research?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The difference between design and research seems to be a question of new versus good. Design doesn't have to be new, but it has to be good. Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new. I think these two paths converge at the top: the best design surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research solves problems that are not only new but actually worth solving. So ultimately, we're aiming for the same destination, just approaching it from different directions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does user-centered design differ from traditional design approaches?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The biggest difference is that you focus more on the user. Design begins by asking, \"Who is this for and what do they need from it?\" A good architect, for example, does not begin by creating a design that he then imposes on the users, but by studying the intended users and figuring out what they need."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of design?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The primary criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of design is how well it works for the user. If you create a novel that bores everyone or a chair that is horribly uncomfortable to sit in, then you've done a bad job, period. It's no defense to say that the novel or the chair is designed according to the most advanced theoretical principles."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to go beyond user feedback when designing products?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "However, making what works for the user doesn't mean simply making what the user tells you to. Users don't know what all the choices are and are often mistaken about what they really want."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the importance of understanding user needs beyond their stated desires in design?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer to the paradox, I think, is that you have to design for the user, but you have to design what the user needs, not simply what he says he wants. It's much like being a doctor. You can't just treat a patient's symptoms. When a patient tells you his symptoms, you have to figure out what's actually wrong with him and treat that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important to define a specific user group when evaluating design quality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If good design must do what the user needs, who is the user? When I say that design must be for users, I don't mean to imply that good design aims at some kind of lowest common denominator. You can pick any group of users you want. If you're designing a tool, for example, you can design it for anyone from beginners to experts, and what's good design for one group might be bad for another. The point is, you have to pick some group of users. I don't think you can even talk about good or bad design except with reference to some intended user."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it beneficial for designers to include themselves among the intended users of their designs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Including oneself among the intended users of a design is beneficial because you are most likely to achieve good design when the intended users include the designer. When you design something for a group that does not include you, it tends to be for people you consider to be less sophisticated than yourself, rather than more sophisticated."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the approach to design differ between user-focused fields and disciplines like mathematics and science?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Even if you're designing something for the most sophisticated users, you're still designing for humans. It's different in research. In math, you don't choose abstractions because they're easy for humans to understand; you choose whichever makes the proof shorter. I think this is true for the sciences generally. Scientific ideas are not meant to be ergonomic."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do human interests and limitations influence the field of design and the arts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the arts, things are very different. Design is all about people. The human body is a strange thing, but when you're designing a chair, that's what you're designing for, and there's no way around it. All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations of humans. In painting, for example, all other things being equal, a painting with people in it will be more interesting than one without. It is not merely an accident of history that the great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of people. If they hadn't been, painting as a medium wouldn't have the prestige that it does."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are programming languages designed instead of using machine language directly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Programming languages are designed instead of using machine language directly because they cater to human cognitive limitations. Like it or not, programming languages are also for people, and I suspect the human brain is just as lumpy and idiosyncratic as the human body. Some ideas are easy for people to grasp, and some aren't. For example, we seem to have a very limited capacity for dealing with detail. It's this fact that makes programming languages a good idea in the first place; if we could handle the detail, we could just program in machine language."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of choosing the right medium when developing ideas versus presenting finished works?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Remember, too, that languages are not primarily a form for finished programs, but something that programs have to be developed in. Anyone in the arts could tell you that you might want different mediums for the two situations. Marble, for example, is a nice, durable medium for finished ideas, but a hopelessly inflexible one for developing new ideas."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common misconception about evaluating programming languages based on the appearance of written code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A common misconception about evaluating programming languages is that we often act as if the test of a language were how good finished programs look in it. It seems so convincing when you see the same program written in two languages, and one version is much shorter. When you approach the problem from the direction of the arts, you're less likely to depend on this sort of test. You don't want to end up with a programming language like marble."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the presence of a read-eval-print loop influence the design and usability of a programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, it is a huge win in developing software to have an interactive toplevel, what in Lisp is called a read-eval-print loop. When you have one, this has real effects on the design of the language. It would not work well for a language where you have to declare variables before using them, for example. When you're just typing expressions into the toplevel, you want to be able to set x to some value and then start doing things to x. You don't want to have to declare the type of x first. You may dispute either of the premises, but if a language has to have a toplevel to be convenient, and mandatory type declarations are incompatible with a toplevel, then no language that makes type declarations mandatory could be convenient to program in."}]}

You have to calibrate your ideas on actual users constantly, especially in the beginning. One of the reasons Jane Austen's novels are so good is that she read them out loud to her family. That's why she never sinks into self-indulgently arty descriptions of landscapes or pretentious philosophizing. (The philosophy's there, but it's woven into the story instead of being pasted onto it like a label.) If you open an average \"literary\" novel and imagine reading it out loud to your friends as something you'd written, you'll feel all too keenly what an imposition that kind of thing is upon the reader."}]}

But one of the main ideas in that mix is that if you're building something new, you should get a prototype in front of users as soon as possible."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the Hail Mary strategy, and why is it considered risky for startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The alternative approach might be called the Hail Mary strategy. Instead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually refining it, you try to create the complete, finished product in one long touchdown pass. As far as I know, this is a recipe for disaster. Countless startups destroyed themselves this way during the Internet bubble. I've never heard of a case where it worked."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the principle of \"Worse is Better\" apply to drawing techniques in the Renaissance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What people outside the software world may not realize is that \"Worse is Better\" is found throughout the arts. In drawing, for example, the idea was discovered during the Renaissance. Now, almost every drawing teacher will tell you that the right way to get an accurate drawing is not to work your way slowly around the contour of an object, because errors will accumulate and you'll find at the end that the lines don't meet. Instead, you should draw a few quick lines in roughly the right place and then gradually refine this initial sketch."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some traditional methods used to create prototypes in various fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In most fields, prototypes have traditionally been made out of different materials. Typefaces to be cut in metal were initially designed with a brush on paper. Statues to be cast in bronze were modeled in wax. Patterns to be embroidered on tapestries were drawn on paper with ink wash. Buildings to be constructed from stone were tested on a smaller scale in wood."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What flexibility do artists have when creating a prototype for a painting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The prototype allows for significant flexibility. You could make a preliminary drawing if you wanted to, but you weren't held to it; you could work out all the details and even make major changes as you finished the painting."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of refining a software prototype into a finished product?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Refining a software prototype into a finished product has several benefits. A prototype doesn't have to be just a model; you can refine it into the finished product. It allows you to take advantage of new insights you gain along the way. Perhaps even more importantly, it's good for morale."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does an artist's engagement and interest in their work affect the quality of their designs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Morale is key in design. I'm surprised people don't talk more about it. One of my first drawing teachers told me: if you're bored when you're drawing something, the drawing will look boring. For example, suppose you have to draw a building, and you decide to draw each brick individually. You can do this if you want, but if you get bored halfway through and start making the bricks mechanically instead of observing each one, the drawing will look worse than if you had merely suggested the bricks."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the process of gradually refining a prototype contribute to motivation and engagement in both software development and the arts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good for morale because it keeps you engaged. In software, my rule is: always have working code. If you're writing something that you'll be able to test in an hour, then you have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you. The same is true in the arts, particularly in oil painting. Most painters start with a blurry sketch and gradually refine it. If you work this way, then in principle, you never have to end the day with something that actually looks unfinished. Indeed, there is even a saying among painters: \"A painting is never finished; you just stop working on it.\" This idea will be familiar to anyone who has worked on software."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the key difference between design and research in terms of collaboration and control?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The key difference between design and research in terms of collaboration and control is that design usually has to be under the control of a single person to be any good. In contrast, it seems possible for several people to collaborate on a research project. This seems to me one of the most interesting differences between research and design."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it important for decision-making in design to ultimately rest with one individual?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm not saying that good design requires that one person think of everything. There's nothing more valuable than the advice of someone whose judgment you trust. But after the talking is done, the decision about what to do has to rest with one person."}]}

This seems to me an important question, maybe the most important question for anyone interested in language design, and one that it would be useful to confront directly. I don't feel sure yet that the answer is a simple yes, but it seems a good hypothesis to begin with."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary advantage of using high-level programming languages over machine language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Computers would be just as happy to be told what to do directly in machine language. I think that the main reason we take the trouble to develop high-level languages is to gain leverage, so that we can say (and more importantly, think) in 10 lines of a high-level language what would require 1000 lines of machine language. In other words, the main point of high-level languages is to make source code smaller."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the measure of the power of a programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If smaller source code is the purpose of high-level languages, and the power of something is how well it achieves its purpose, then the measure of the power of a programming language is how small it makes your programs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of using lines of code as a measure of program size?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The most common measure of code size is lines of code. However, this metric is prevalent primarily because it is the easiest to measure. I don't think anyone really believes it is the true test of the length of a program. Different languages have different conventions for how much you should put on a line; in C, many lines contain nothing but a delimiter or two."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might the number of characters in a program not be a reliable measure of its complexity or efficiency?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The number of characters in a program can be an easy test for complexity, but it is not a reliable measure; some languages, such as Perl, use shorter identifiers than others."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria can be used to measure the size of a programming language's source code more effectively?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think a better measure of the size of a program would be the number of elements, where an element is anything that would be a distinct node if you drew a tree representing the source code. The name of a variable or function is an element; an integer or a floating-point number is an element; a segment of literal text is an element; an element of a pattern, or a format directive, is an element; a new block is an element. There are borderline cases (is -5 two elements or one?), but I think most of them are the same for every language, so they don't affect comparisons much."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the metric discussed in the paragraph aim to measure regarding programming and program structure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This metric needs fleshing out, and it could require interpretation in the case of specific languages, but I think it tries to measure the right thing, which is the number of parts a program has. I think the tree you'd draw in this exercise is what you have to make in your head in order to conceive of the program, and so its size is proportionate to the amount of work you have to do to write or read it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary purpose of the succinctness test in evaluating programming languages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The primary purpose of the succinctness test in evaluating programming languages is to serve as a guide in comparing different languages. While this kind of metric allows for comparisons, its main value lies in helping developers understand the expressiveness and efficiency of a language."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can aiming for succinctness in programming lead to the discovery of new abstractions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Aiming for succinctness seems like a good way to find new ideas. If you can do something that makes many different programs shorter, it is probably not a coincidence; you have likely discovered a useful new abstraction. You might even be able to write a program to help by searching source code for repeated patterns. Among other languages, those with a reputation for succinctness would be the ones to look to for new ideas: Forth, Joy, and Icon."}]}

When I first read this in my early twenties, it was a big surprise to me and seemed to have huge implications. It meant that (a) the only way to get software written faster was to use a more succinct language, and (b) someone who took the trouble to do this could leave competitors who didn't in the dust."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criteria should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of programming languages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have not yet seen evidence that seemed conclusive, and I don't expect to. Studies like Lutz Prechelt's comparison of programming languages, while generating the kind of results I expected, tend to use problems that are too short to be meaningful tests. A better test of a language is what happens in programs that take a month to write. And the only real test, if you believe, as I do, that the main purpose of a language is to be good to think in (rather than just to tell a computer what to do once you've thought of it), is what new things you can write in it. So any language comparison where you have to meet a predefined spec is testing slightly the wrong thing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes the effectiveness of different artistic mediums in terms of problem-solving and creativity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The true test of a language is how well you can discover and solve new problems, not how well you can use it to solve a problem someone else has already formulated. These two are quite different criteria. In art, mediums like embroidery and mosaic work well if you know beforehand what you want to make, but are absolutely lousy if you don't. When you want to discover the image as you make itâas you have to do with anything as complex as an image of a person, for exampleâyou need to use a more fluid medium like pencil or ink wash or oil paint. And indeed, the way tapestries and mosaics are made in practice is to make a painting first, then copy it.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are comparisons of programming languages often not accurate?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Accurate comparisons of programming languages are challenging because we are unlikely to achieve a true measure of their relative power. While we can make precise comparisons, they often lack accuracy. In particular, explicit studies aimed at comparing languages tend to use small, predefined problems, which can underestimate the capabilities of more powerful languages."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the willingness of programmers to accept jobs using a specific language indicate about the language's power?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The willingness of programmers to accept jobs using a specific language indicates the language's power.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does it feel like when a programming language feels restrictive to a hacker?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think most hackers know what it means for a language to feel restrictive. What's happening when you feel that? I think it's the same feeling you get when the street you want to take is blocked off, and you have to take a long detour to get where you wanted to go.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between succinctness and the perception of restrictiveness in programming languages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think most (ninety percent?) of the feeling of restrictiveness comes from being forced to make the program you write in the language longer than the one you have in your head. Restrictiveness is mostly a lack of succinctness. So when a language feels restrictive, what that (mostly) means is that it isn't succinct enough, and when a language isn't succinct, it will feel restrictive."}]}

It's the second that matters. I agree that a line of Basic is likely to be more readable than a line of Lisp. But a program written in Basic is going to have more lines than the same program written in Lisp (especially once you cross over into Greenspunland). The total effort of reading the Basic program will surely be greater."}]}

If you're used to reading novels and newspaper articles, your first experience of reading a math paper can be dismaying. It could take half an hour to read a single page. And yet, I am pretty sure that the notation is not the problem, even though it may feel like it is. The math paper is hard to read because the ideas are hard. If you expressed the same ideas in prose (as mathematicians had to do before they evolved succinct notations), they wouldn't be any easier to read because the paper would grow to the size of a book."}]}

If writing some hairy macro could save you ten lines of code every time you use it, and the macro is itself ten lines of code, then you get a net saving in lines if you use it more than once.

If there is such a thing as beauty, we need to be able to recognize it. We need good taste to make good things. Instead of treating beauty as an airy abstraction to be either blathered about or avoided depending on how one feels about airy abstractions, let's try considering it as a practical question:"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to the perception of taste as subjective?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell you that \"taste is subjective.\" They believe this because it really feels that way to them. When they like something, they have no idea why. It could be because it's beautiful, or because their mother had one, or because they saw a movie star with one in a magazine, or because they know it's expensive. Their thoughts are a tangle of unexamined impulses."}]}

Your tastes will change. And, like anyone who gets better at their job, you'll know you're getting better. If so, your old tastes were not merely different but worse. Poof goes the axiom that taste can't be wrong."}]}

But if you come out of the closet and admit, at least to yourself, that there is such a thing as good and bad design, then you can start to study good design in detail. How has your taste changed? When you made mistakes, what caused you to make them? What have other people learned about design?"}]}

In mathematics, it suggests that a shorter proof is often a better one, particularly concerning axioms. This principle also holds in programming, where concise code is typically more effective. For architects and designers, it means that beauty should rely on a few carefully chosen structural elements rather than an excess of superficial ornamentation. While ornamentation is not inherently negative, it can detract from the form if it serves merely as camouflage for a lack of substance. In painting, a still life composed of a few well-observed and solidly modeled objects tends to be more engaging than a flashy but mindlessly repetitive depiction, such as a lace collar. In writing, it translates to expressing ideas clearly and succinctly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do many creative individuals complicate their work instead of embracing simplicity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems strange to have to emphasize simplicity. You'd think simple would be the default. Ornate is more work. But something seems to come over people when they try to be creative. Beginning writers adopt a pompous tone that doesn't sound anything like the way they speak. Designers trying to be artistic resort to swooshes and curlicues. Painters discover that they're expressionists. It's all evasion. Underneath the long words or the \"expressive\" brush strokes, there is not much going on, and that's frightening."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is Hardy's perspective on the nature of mathematical solutions in relation to beauty and correctness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In math, every proof is timeless unless it contains a mistake.

There must be a better one, and eventually, someone will discover it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can striving for timelessness in one's work influence creativity and mastery?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Aiming for timelessness is a way to make yourself find the best answer: if you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself. Some of the greatest masters did this so well that they left little room for those who came after. Every engraver since DÃ¼rer has had to live in his shadow."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does aiming for timelessness in design help avoid the influence of changing fashion trends?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Aiming for timelessness is also a way to evade the grip of fashion. Fashions, almost by definition, change with time, so if you can make something that will still look good far into the future, then its appeal must derive more from merit and less from fashion."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can creating a product or idea that resonates with historical preferences enhance its appeal to future generations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strangely enough, if you want to make something that will appeal to future generations, one way to do it is to try to appeal to past generations. It's hard to guess what the future will be like, but we can be sure it will be like the past in caring nothing for present fashions. So, if you can make something that appeals to people today and would also have appealed to people in 1500, there is a good chance it will appeal to people in 2500."}]}

Likewise, a painting that suggests is usually more engaging than one that tells. Everyone makes up their own story about the Mona Lisa."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the principle of user-centered design imply for architecture and design?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In architecture and design, this principle means that a building or object should let you use it how you want.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of providing foundational elements in software, math, and science for fostering creativity and future advancements?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In software, it means you should give users a few basic elements that they can combine as they wish, like Lego. In math, it means a proof that becomes the basis for a lot of new work is preferable to a proof that was difficult but doesn't lead to future discoveries. In the sciences generally, citation is considered a rough indicator of merit."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is a sense of humor considered a sign of strength?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's because humor is related to strength. To have a sense of humor is to be strong: to keep one's sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes, and to lose one's sense of humor is to be wounded by them. And so the markâor at least the prerogativeâof strength is not to take oneself too seriously. The confident will often, like swallows, seem to be making fun of the whole process slightly, as Hitchcock does in his films or Bruegel in his paintingsâor Shakespeare, for that matter."}]}

Fashions and flourishes get knocked aside by the difficult business of solving the problem at all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes beneficial challenges from detrimental ones in design and physical activities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not every kind of hard is good.

A difficult problem could be good for a designer, but a fickle client or unreliable materials would not be."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why have paintings of people traditionally been considered the highest form of art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In art, the highest place has traditionally been given to paintings of people. There is something to this tradition, and not just because pictures of faces press buttons in our brains that other pictures don't. We are so good at looking at faces that we force anyone who draws them to work hard to satisfy us. If you draw a tree and change the angle of a branch five degrees, no one will know. When you change the angle of someone's eye five degrees, people notice."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does practice contribute to the development of expertise in various fields?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In most fields, the appearance of ease seems to come with practice. Perhaps what practice does is train your unconscious mind to handle tasks that used to require conscious thought. In some cases, you literally train your body. An expert pianist can play notes faster than the brain can send signals to his hand. Likewise, an artist, after a while, can make visual perception flow in through his eye and out through his hand as automatically as someone tapping his foot to a beat."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of symmetry in architecture evolved from the Victorian era to modernism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Symmetry is unfashionable in some fields now, in reaction to excesses in the past. Architects started consciously making buildings asymmetric in Victorian times, and by the 1920s, asymmetry was an explicit premise of modernist architecture. Even these buildings only tended to be asymmetric about major axes; there were hundreds of minor symmetries."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does symmetry contribute to the impact of writing, music, and visual art?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In writing, you find symmetry at every level, from the phrases in a sentence to the plot of a novel. You find the same in music and art. Mosaics (and some Cezannes) gain extra visual punch by making the whole picture out of the same atoms. Compositional symmetry yields some of the most memorable paintings, especially when two halves react to one another, as in the balance of color and form."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some advantages of using recursion in math, engineering, and software design?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In math and engineering, recursion is especially advantageous. Inductive proofs are wonderfully short. In software, a problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly always best solved that way. The Eiffel Tower looks striking partly because it is a recursive solution, a tower on a tower."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it beneficial for solutions to resemble natural processes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's not so much that resembling nature is intrinsically good as that nature has had a long time to work on the problem.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of painting from life according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The purpose of painting from life is that it gives your mind something to chew on: when your eyes are looking at something, your hand will do more interesting work. It's not cheating to copy. Few would deny that a story should be like life. Working from life is a valuable tool in painting too, though its role has often been misunderstood. The aim is not simply to make a record."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do beginner artists often hesitate to revise their drawings?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When people first start drawing, they are often reluctant to redo parts that aren't right; they feel they've been lucky to get that far, and if they try to redo something, it will turn out worse. Instead, they convince themselves that the drawing is not that bad, reallyâin fact, maybe they meant it to look that way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can embracing mistakes contribute to improvement in creative processes and software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mistakes are natural. Instead of treating them as disasters, we should make them easy to acknowledge and easy to fix. Leonardo more or less invented the sketch as a way to make drawing bear a greater weight of exploration. Open-source software has fewer bugs because it admits the possibility of bugs."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do attitudes towards copying evolve in the creative process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Attitudes towards copying often make a round trip.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criticism did the Pre-Raphaelites have regarding the influence of Raphael on artistic imitation in the mid-nineteenth century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Unknowing imitation is almost a recipe for bad design. If you don't know where your ideas are coming from, you're probably imitating an imitator. Raphael so pervaded mid-nineteenth-century taste that almost anyone who tried to draw was imitating him, often at several removes. It was this, more than Raphael's own work, that bothered the Pre-Raphaelites."}]}

A thousand Leonardos and a thousand Michelangelos walk among us. If DNA ruled, we should be greeted daily by artistic marvels. We aren't, and the reason is that to make a Leonardo, you need more than his innate ability. You also need Florence in 1450."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some historical examples of artists and scientists facing backlash for their groundbreaking work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This problem afflicts not just every era, but to some degree every field. Much Renaissance art was, in its time, considered shockingly secular: according to Vasari, Botticelli repented and gave up painting, and Fra Bartolommeo and Lorenzo di Credi actually burned some of their work.

Common Lisp has an enormously powerful object system, and I've never used it once. I've done a lot of things (e.g., making hash tables full of closures) that would have required object-oriented techniques to do in wimpier languages, but I have never had to use CLOS. Maybe I'm just stupid, or have worked on some limited subset of applications. There is a danger in designing a language based on one's own experience of programming.

About a year ago, she was alarmed to receive a letter from Apple, offering her a discount on a new version of the operating system.

And so you won't ordinarily need a computer, per se, to use software. All you'll need will be something with a keyboard, a screen, and a web browser. Maybe it will have wireless Internet access. Maybe it will also be your cell phone. Whatever it is, it will be consumer electronics: something that costs about $200, and that people choose mostly based on how the case looks.

This is an obvious win for collaborative applications, but I bet users will start to want this in most applications once they realize it's possible. It is often useful to let two people edit the same document, for example. Viaweb allowed multiple users to edit a site simultaneously, more because that was the right way to write the software than because we expected users to want to, but it turned out that many did."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do Web-based applications enhance data safety compared to local storage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you use a Web-based application, your data will be safer. Disk crashes won't be a thing of the past, but users won't hear about them anymore. They'll happen within server farms. Companies offering Web-based applications will actually do backupsânot only because they'll have real system administrators worrying about such things, but because an ASP that does lose people's data will be in big, big trouble. When people lose their own data in a disk crash, they can't get that mad, because they only have themselves to be mad at. When a company loses their data for them, they'll get a lot madder."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does web-based software reduce the risk of virus infections compared to traditional software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finally, web-based software should be less vulnerable to viruses. If the client doesn't run anything except a browser, there's less chance of running viruses, and there is no data locally to damage. Additionally, a program that attacks the servers themselves should find them very well defended."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What potential does the average Windows user have for embracing new software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think if you looked inside the average Windows user, you'd find a huge and pretty much untapped desire for software meeting that description. Unleashed, it could be a powerful force."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key considerations for designing Web-based applications compared to traditional desktop software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To developers, the most conspicuous difference between Web-based and desktop software is that a Web-based application is not a single piece of code. It will be a collection of programs of different types rather than a single big binary. And so designing Web-based software is like designing a city rather than a building: as well as buildings, you need roads, street signs, utilities, police and fire departments, and plans for both growth and various kinds of disasters."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What considerations were taken into account during the server setup process?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It did not end with software. We spent a lot of time thinking about server configurations. We built the servers ourselves, from componentsâpartly to save money and partly to get exactly what we wanted. We had to consider whether our upstream ISP had fast enough connections to all the backbones."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does controlling hardware enhance user experience and provide a competitive advantage in software applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Controlling hardware is not just a concern; it enhances user experience significantly. When you have control over the hardware, you can do more for users. With a desktop application, you can specify certain minimum hardware requirements, but you can't add more capabilities. If you administer the servers, you can enable all your users to page people, send faxes, send commands by phone, or process credit cards, simply by installing the relevant hardware. We always looked for new ways to add features with hardware, not just because it pleased users, but also as a way to distinguish ourselves from competitors who, either because they sold desktop software or resold web-based applications through ISPs, didn't have direct control over the hardware."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of using multiple programming languages in web-based applications compared to desktop software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because the software in a web-based application will be a collection of programs rather than a single binary, it can be written in any number of different languages. When you're writing desktop software, you're practically forced to write the application in the same language as the underlying operating systemâmeaning C and C++. As a result, these languages (especially among nontechnical people like managers and VCs) came to be considered the languages for \"serious\" software development. However, that was just an artifact of the way desktop software had to be delivered. For server-based software, you can use any language you want. Today, a lot of the top hackers are using languages far removed from C and C++: Perl, Python, and even Lisp."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantages do you have when using server-based software regarding programming language choices?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With server-based software, no one can tell you what language to use because you control the whole system, right down to the hardware. Different languages are good for different tasks, and you can use whichever is best for each. When you have competitors, \"you can\" means \"you must\" (we'll return to this later) because if you don't take advantage of this possibility, your competitors will."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the release frequency of server-based software compare to that of typical desktop software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With server-based software, you can make changes almost as you would in a program you were writing for yourself. You release software as a series of incremental changes instead of an occasional big explosion. A typical desktop software company might do one or two releases a year. At Viaweb, we often did three to five releases a day."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the release process impact software development issues in the desktop software industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you switch to this new model, you realize how much software development is affected by the way it is released. Many of the nastiest problems you see in the desktop software business are due to the catastrophic nature of releases."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do software developers face when releasing only one version per year?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you release only one new version a year, you tend to deal with bugs wholesale. Some time before the release date, you assemble a new version in which half the code has been torn out and replaced, introducing countless bugs. Then a squad of QA people steps in and starts counting them, and the programmers work down the list, fixing them. They do not generally get to the end of the list, and indeed, no one is sure where the end is. It's like fishing rubble out of a pond. You never really know what's happening inside the software. At best, you end up with a statistical sort of correctness."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of using server-based software in terms of code changes and testing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With server-based software, most of the changes are small and incremental. That, in itself, is less likely to introduce bugs. It also means you know what to test most carefully when you're about to release software: the last thing you changed. You end up with a much firmer grip on the code. As a general rule, you do know what's happening inside it. You don't have the source code memorized, of course, but when you read the source, you do it like a pilot scanning the instrument panel, not like a detective trying to unravel some mystery."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What attitude do developers often adopt towards bugs in desktop software, and how does it affect their approach to feature releases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Desktop software breeds a certain fatalism about bugs. You know that you're shipping something loaded with bugs, and you've even set up mechanisms to compensate for it (e.g., patch releases). So why worry about a few more? Soon, you're releasing whole features you know are broken."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did the company choose to release their new operating system despite some features not being ready?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "They felt under pressure to release their new OS, whose release date had already slipped four times, but some of the software (support for CDs and DVDs) wasn't ready. The solution? They released the OS without the unfinished parts, and users will have to install them later."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the concept of software versions differ between traditional software and Web-based software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The industry veteran may be thinking, \"It's a fine-sounding idea to say that you never have to release software before it works, but what happens when you've promised to deliver a new version of your software by a certain date?\" With Web-based software, you wouldn't make such a promise because there are no versions. Your software changes gradually and continuously. Some changes might be bigger than others, but the idea of versions just doesn't naturally fit onto Web-based software."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did Viaweb frequently announce new versions of their software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If anyone remembers Viaweb, this might sound odd because we were always announcing new versions. This was done entirely for PR purposes. The trade press, we learned, thinks in version numbers. They will give you major coverage for a major release, meaning a new first digit on the version number, and generally a paragraph at most for a point release, meaning a new digit after the decimal point."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why did the company decide to start assigning version numbers to their software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some of our competitors were offering desktop software and actually had version numbers. For these releases, the mere fact of which seemed to us evidence of their backwardness, they would get all kinds of publicity. We didn't want to miss out, so we started giving version numbers to our software too. When we wanted some publicity, we'd make a list of all the features we'd added since the last \"release,\" stick a new version number on the software, and issue a press release saying that the new version was available immediately. Amazingly, no one ever called us on it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the acquisition of Viaweb by Yahoo impact the software versioning and publicity strategy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By the time we were bought, we had done this three times, so we were on Version 4, Version 4.1 if I remember correctly. After Viaweb became Yahoo Store, there was no longer such a desperate need for publicity, so although the software continued to evolve, the whole idea of version numbers was quietly dropped."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a key benefit of Web-based software in terms of debugging compared to desktop software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The other major technical advantage of Web-based software is that you can reproduce most bugs. You have the users' data right there on your disk. If someone breaks your software, you don't have to try to guess what's going on, as you would with desktop software; you should be able to reproduce the error while they're on the phone with you. You might even know about it already if you have code for noticing errors built into your application."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of releasing Web-based software gradually in terms of debugging?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Software companies are sometimes accused of letting the users debug their software. And that is just what I'm advocating. For Web-based software, it's actually a good plan because the bugs are fewer and transient. When you release software gradually, you get far fewer bugs to start with. And when you can reproduce errors and release changes instantly, you can find and fix most bugs as soon as they appear. We never had enough bugs at any one time to bother with a formal bug-tracking system."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it generally easier to fix bugs in recently written code compared to older code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fixing fresh bugs is easier than fixing old ones. It's usually fairly quick to find a bug in code you just wrote. When it turns up, you often know what's wrong before you even look at the source because you were already worrying about it subconsciously. Fixing a bug in something you wrote six months ago (the average case if you release once a year) is a lot more work. Since you don't understand the code as well, you're more likely to fix it in an ugly way or even introduce more bugs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of catching bugs early in software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you catch bugs early, you also get fewer compound bugs. Compound bugs are two separate bugs that interact: you trip going downstairs, and when you reach for the handrail, it comes off in your hand. In software, this kind of bug is the hardest to find and also tends to have the worst consequences. The traditional \"break everything and then filter out the bugs\" approach inherently yields a lot of compound bugs. Software that's released in a series of small changes inherently tends not to. The floors are constantly being swept clean of any loose objects that might later get stuck in something."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of using functional programming in web-based applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Functional programming offers several benefits for web-based applications. It involves avoiding side effects, which can lead to cleaner and more predictable code. While you may encounter functional programming more often in research papers than in commercial software, it proves to be quite useful in web development. Although it can be challenging to write entire programs in a purely functional style, you can implement substantial portions of your code this way. This approach makes those parts of your software easier to test, as they have no state, which is very convenient when you are constantly making and testing small modifications. I wrote much of Viaweb's editor in this style, and we made our scripting language."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did advanced users at Viaweb perceive and respond to software bugs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People from the desktop software business will find this hard to credit, but at Viaweb, bugs became almost a game. Since most released bugs involved borderline cases, the users who encountered them were likely to be advanced users pushing the envelope. Advanced users are more forgiving about bugs, especially since you probably introduced them in the course of adding some feature they were asking for. In fact, because bugs were rare and you had to be doing sophisticated things to see them, advanced users were often proud to catch one. They would call support in a spirit more of triumph than anger, as if they had scored points off us."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Viaweb approach customer support and feedback?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At Viaweb, support was free because we wanted to hear from customers. If someone had a problem, we wanted to know about it right away so that we could reproduce the error and release a fix."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the proximity of developers to customer support at Viaweb impact their ability to address bugs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At Viaweb, the developers were always in close contact with support. The customer support people were about thirty feet away from the programmers and knew that they could always interrupt anything with a report of a genuine bug. We would leave a board meeting to fix a serious bug."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the new customer support approach benefit customers, support staff, and programmers alike?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Our approach to support made everyone happier. The customers were delighted. Just imagine how it would feel to call a support line and be treated as someone bringing important news. The customer support people liked it because it meant they could help the users instead of reading scripts to them. And the programmers liked it because they could reproduce bugs instead of just hearing vague second-hand reports about them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role did customer support play in the development and marketing of products after the acquisition by Yahoo?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "After we were bought by Yahoo, the customer support people were moved far away from the programmers. It was only then that we realized that they were effectively QA and, to some extent, marketing as well. In addition to catching bugs, they were the keepers of the knowledge of vaguer, bug-like things, like features that confused users. They were also a kind of proxy focus group; we could ask them which of two new features users wanted more, and they were always right."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of having the ability to release software immediately?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Being able to release software immediately is a big motivator. Often, as I was walking to work, I would think of some change I wanted to make to the software and do it that day. This worked for bigger features as well. Even if something was going to take two weeks to write (few projects took longer), I knew I could see the effect in the software as soon as it was done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the process of implementing one idea influence the generation of new ideas in creative projects?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If I'd had to wait a year for the next release, I would have shelved most of these ideas, for a while at least. The thing about ideas, though, is that they lead to more ideas. Have you ever noticed that when you sit down to write something, half the ideas that end up in it are ones you thought of while writing it? The same thing happens with software. Working to implement one idea gives you more ideas. So shelving an idea costs you not only that delay in implementing it but also all the ideas that implementing it would have led to. In fact, shelving an idea probably even inhibits new ideas: as you start to think of some new feature, you catch sight of the shelf and think, \"but I already have a lot of new things I want to do for the next release.\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between planning and implementation in the context of innovation at Viaweb?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What big companies do instead of implementing features is plan them. At Viaweb, we sometimes ran into trouble on this account. Investors and analysts would ask us what we had planned for the future. The truthful answer would have been that we didn't have any plans. We had general ideas about things we wanted to improve, but if we knew how, we would have done it already. What were we going to do in the next six months? Whatever looked like the biggest win. I don't know if I ever dared to give this answer, but that was the truth. Plans are just another word for ideas on the shelf. When we thought of good ideas, we implemented them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors contribute to software release reliability in a company with individual code ownership?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At Viaweb, as at many software companies, most code had one definite owner. But when you owned something, you really owned it: no one except the owner of a piece of software had to approve (or even know about) a release. There was no protection against breakage except the fear of looking like an idiot to one's peers, and that was more than enough. I may have given the impression that we just blithely plowed forward writing code. We did go fast, but we thought very carefully before we released software onto those servers. Paying attention is more important to reliability than moving slowly. Because he pays close attention, a Navy pilot can land a 40,000 lb. aircraft at 140 miles per hour on a pitching carrier deck, at night, more safely than the average teenager can cut a bagel."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the team size for Web-based software development compare to that of traditional desktop software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fortunately, web-based software does require fewer programmers. I once worked for a medium-sized desktop software company that had over 100 people working in engineering as a whole. Only 13 of these were in product development. All the rest were working on releases, ports, and so on. With web-based software, all you need (at most) are the 13 people because there are no releases, ports, and so on."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What strategy did the founders of Viaweb use to address concerns about their small team size while seeking to attract buyers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Viaweb was written by just three people. I was always under pressure to hire more because we wanted to get bought, and we knew that buyers would have a hard time paying a high price for a company with only three programmers. Our solution was to hire more people but create new projects for them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the size of a development team impact the efficiency of software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Adding people to a project tends to slow it down. The number of possible connections between developers grows exponentially with the size of the group. The larger the group, the more time they'll spend in meetings negotiating how their software will work together, and the more bugs they'll get from unforeseen interactions. Fortunately, this process also works in reverse: as groups get smaller, software development gets exponentially more efficient. I can't remember the programmers at Viaweb ever having an actual meeting. We never had more to say at any one time than we could say as we were walking to lunch."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do programmers face when they also have to manage system administration duties?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If there is a downside here, it is that all the programmers have to be, to some degree, system administrators as well. When you're hosting software, someone has to be watching the servers, and in practice, the only people who can do this properly are the ones who wrote the software. At Viaweb, our system had so many components and changed so frequently that there was no definite border between software and infrastructure. Arbitrarily declaring such a border would have constrained our design choices. And so, although we were constantly hoping that one day (\"in a couple of months\") everything would be stable enough that we could hire someone whose job was just to worry about the servers, it never happened."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the ongoing responsibilities of developers for web-based software after its initial launch?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Web-based software is never going to be something you write, check in, and go home. It's a live thing, running on your servers right now. A bad bug might not just crash one user's process; it could crash them all. If a bug in your code corrupts some data on disk, you have to fix it. We found that you don't have to watch the servers every minute (after the first year or so), but you definitely want to keep an eye on things you've changed recently. You don't release code late at night and then go home."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can server-based software enhance our understanding of user behavior compared to traditional methods?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Server-based software enhances our understanding of user behavior compared to traditional methods by providing unprecedented information about their actions. While traditional methods often rely on small, artificial focus groups, server-based software allows you to see every click made by every user. Although you must consider carefully what you are going to analyze to avoid violating users' privacy, even the most general statistical sampling can be very useful in gaining insights into user behavior."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can monitoring actual users on a server improve optimization decisions compared to relying on benchmarks?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Monitoring actual users on a server allows for more informed optimization decisions compared to relying solely on benchmarks, which are based on simulated users. With server-based software, you can observe real user interactions. To determine what to optimize, simply log into the server and identify what is consuming the most CPU resources. Additionally, you can recognize when to stop optimizing; for instance, we eventually improved the Viaweb editor to the point where it was memory-bound rather than CPU-bound. Since there was little we could do to reduce the size of users' data (at least nothing easy), we understood that further optimization efforts were unnecessary."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does software efficiency impact the profitability of server-based applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Efficiency matters for server-based software because you're paying for the hardware. The number of users you can support per server is the divisor of your capital cost, so if you can make your software very efficient, you can undersell competitors and still make a profit. At Viaweb, we got the capital cost per user down to about $5. It would be less now, probably less than the cost of sending them the first month's bill. Hardware is free now if your software is reasonably efficient."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did user feedback influence the design and functionality of Viaweb's RTML scripting language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Watching users can guide you in design as well as optimization. Viaweb had a scripting language called RTML that let advanced users define their own page styles. We found that RTML became a kind of suggestion box because users only used it when the predefined page styles couldn't do what they wanted. Originally, the editor put button bars across the page, but after a number of users used RTML to put buttons down the left side, we adjusted the design to accommodate this feedback."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Viaweb enhance user experience and engagement during their online test drive?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finally, by watching users, you can often tell when they're in trouble. And since the customer is always right, that's a sign of something you need to fix. At Viaweb, the key to getting users was the online test drive. It was not just a series of slides built by marketing people. In our test drive, users actually used the software. It took about five minutes, and at the end of it, they had built a real, working store."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can improving the test drive experience impact user acquisition for Web-based applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The test drive was the way we got nearly all our new users. I think it will be the same for most web-based applications. If users can get through a test drive successfully, they'll like the product. If they get confused or bored, they won't. So anything we can do to get more people through the test drive would increase our growth rate."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did addressing user confusion during a test drive impact completion rates and revenue growth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I studied click trails of people taking the test drive and found that at a certain step they would get confused and click on the browser's Back button. (If you try writing web-based applications, you'll find that the Back button becomes one of your most interesting philosophical problems.) So I added a message at that point, telling users that they were nearly finished and reminding them not to click on the Back button. Another great thing about web-based software is that you get instant feedback from changes: the number of people completing the test drive rose immediately from 60% to 90%. And since the number of new users was a function of the number of completed test drives, our revenue growth increased by 50%, just from that change."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How has the perception of software monetization evolved in relation to subscription models?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the early 1990s, I read an article in which someone said that software was a subscription business. At first, this seemed like a very cynical statement. But later, I realized that it reflects reality: software development is an ongoing process. I think it's cleaner if you openly charge subscription fees instead of forcing people to keep buying and installing new versions so that they'll keep paying you. And fortunately, subscriptions are the natural way to bill for web-based applications."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are companies likely to be the primary providers of hosting applications instead of freeware?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hosting applications is an area where companies will play a role that is not likely to be filled by freeware. Hosting applications involve a lot of stress and incur real expenses. No one is going to want to do it for free."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of Web-based applications for companies in terms of revenue and customer management?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For companies, Web-based applications are an ideal source of revenue. Instead of starting each quarter with a blank slate, you have a recurring revenue stream. Because your software evolves gradually, you don't have to worry that a new model will flop; there never needs to be a new model, per se, and if you do something to the software that users hate, you'll know right away. You have no trouble with uncollectable bills; if someone won't pay, you can just turn off the service. And there is no possibility of piracy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can software piracy potentially benefit companies in terms of user base and market standardization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some amount of piracy is to the advantage of software companies. If a user really would not have bought your software at any price, you haven't lost anything if he uses a pirated copy. In fact, you gain because he is one more user helping to make your software the standardâor who might buy a copy later, when he graduates from high school."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do companies utilize price discrimination in relation to software pricing and piracy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When they can, companies like to do something called price discrimination, which means charging each customer as much as they can afford. Software is particularly suitable for price discrimination because the marginal cost is close to zero. This is why some software costs more to run on Suns than on Intel boxes: a company that uses Suns is not interested in saving money and can safely be charged more. Piracy is effectively the lowest tier of price discrimination. I think that software companies understand this and deliberately turn a blind eye to some kinds of piracy. With server-based software, they are going to have to come up with some other solution."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do web-based software products tend to sell better than desktop software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Web-based software sells well, especially in comparison to desktop software, because it's easy to buy. You might think that people decide to buy something and then buy it as two separate steps. That's what I thought before Viaweb, to the extent I thought about the question at all. In fact, the second step can propagate back into the first: if something is hard to buy, people will change their mind about whether they wanted it. And vice versa: you'll sell more of something when it's easy to buy. I buy more books because Amazon exists. Web-based software is just about the easiest thing in the world to buy, especially if you have just done an online demo. Users should not have to do much more than enter a credit card number. (Make them do more at your peril.)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the risks of using Web-based software provided by ISPs as resellers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Web-based software is sometimes offered through ISPs acting as resellers. This can be a bad idea. You have to administer the servers because you need to be constantly improving both hardware and software. If you give up direct control of the servers, you give up most of the advantages of developing web-based applications."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who are the primary users of Web-based applications according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The primary users of Web-based applications are individuals and smaller companies. At Viaweb, they were initially these types of customers, and I believe this will be the rule with Web-based applications. These users are ready to try new things, partly because they are more flexible and partly because they want the lower costs of new technology."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of using web-based applications for large companies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Web-based applications are often the best solution for large companies, though they may be slow to realize it. The best intranet is the Internet. If a company uses true web-based applications, the software will work better, the servers will be better administered, and employees will have access to the system from anywhere."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential benefits of outsourcing IT services for companies that rely on Web-based applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Outsourcing IT services can provide significant benefits for companies that rely on Web-based applications. Drastic as it sounds, I think this is generally a good idea. Companies are likely to get better service this way than they would from in-house system administrators. System administrators can become cranky and unresponsive because they're not directly exposed to competitive pressure: a salesman has to deal with customers, and a developer has to deal with competitors' software, but a system administrator, like an old bachelor, has few external forces to keep him in line. At Viaweb, we had external forces in plenty to keep us in line. The people calling us were customers, not just co-workers. If a server got wedged, we jumped; just thinking about it gives me a jolt of adrenaline, years later."}]}

It was written by two individuals working in an attic, and yet it did things no mainframe software could do. VisiCalc was such an advance in its time that people bought Apple IIs just to run it.

Computers are so cheap now that you can get started, as we did, using a desktop computer as a server. Inexpensive processors have eaten the workstation market (you rarely even hear the word now) and are most of the way through the server market; Yahoo's servers, which deal with loads as high as any on the Internet, all have the same inexpensive Intel processors that you have in your desktop machine. And once you've written the software, all you need to sell it is a website. Nearly all our users came directly to our site through word of mouth and references in the press."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What initial challenges did the founders of Viaweb face when starting their company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Viaweb was a typical larval startup. We were terrified of starting a company, and for the first few months, we comforted ourselves by treating the whole thing as an experiment that we might call off at any moment. Fortunately, there were few obstacles except technical ones. While we were writing the software, our web server was the same desktop machine we used for development, connected to the outside world by a dial-up line. Our only expenses in that phase were food and rent."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantages did the web provide for software development compared to traditional desktop software?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't think we would have started a startup to write desktop software because desktop software has to run on Windows, and before we could write software for Windows, we'd have to use it. The Web let us do an end-run around Windows and deliver software running on Unix directly to users through the browser. That is a liberating prospect, a lot like the arrival of PCs twenty-five years ago."}]}

I mentioned earlier that my mother doesn't really need a desktop computer, and most users probably don't either. This trend is a problem for Microsoft, and they know it. If applications run on remote servers, no one needs Windows. What will Microsoft do? Will they be able to use their control of the desktop to prevent or constrain this new generation of software?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What future developments in Microsoft's operating system strategy are anticipated regarding server and desktop integration?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My guess is that Microsoft will develop some kind of server/desktop hybrid, where the operating system works together with servers they control. At a minimum, files will be centrally available for users who want that. I don't expect Microsoft to go all the way to the extreme of doing the computations on the server, with only a browser for a client, if they can avoid it. If you only need a browser for a client, you don't need Microsoft on the client, and if Microsoft doesn't control the client, they can't push users towards their server-based applications."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges might Microsoft face in maintaining control over its applications across different client types?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think Microsoft will have a hard time keeping the genie in the bottle.

With the rise of Web-based software, they will be facing not just technical problems but their own wishful thinking. What they need to do is cannibalize their existing business, and I can't see them facing that. The same single-mindedness that has brought them this far will now be working against them. IBM was in exactly the same situation, and they could not master it. IBM made a late and half-hearted entry into the microcomputer business because they were ambivalent about threatening their cash cow, mainframe computing. Microsoft will likewise be hampered by wanting to save the desktop. A cash cow can be a damned heavy monkey on your back."}]}

In 1960, software development meant a roomful of men with horn-rimmed glasses and narrow black neckties, industriously writing ten lines of code a day on IBM coding forms. In 1980, it was a team of eight to ten people wearing jeans to the office and typing into VT100s. Now, it's a couple of guys sitting in a living room with laptops.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the challenges and pressures faced by startups developing Web-based applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Startups are stressful, and this, unfortunately, is also taken to an extreme with Web-based applications. Many software companies, especially at the beginning, have periods where the developers sleep under their desks and so on. The alarming thing about Web-based software is that there is nothing to prevent this from becoming the default. The stories about sleeping under desks usually end: then at last we shipped it, and we all went home and slept for a week. Web-based software never ships. You can work 16-hour days for as long as you want to. And because you can, and your competitors can, you tend to be forced to. You can, so you must. It's Parkinson's Law running in reverse."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do Web-based applications blur the responsibilities and stresses of programmers and system administrators?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The worst thing is not the hours but the responsibility. Programmers and system administrators traditionally each have their own separate worries. Programmers have to worry about bugs, and system administrators have to worry about infrastructure. Programmers may spend a long day up to their elbows in source code, but at some point, they get to go home and forget about it. System administrators never quite leave the job behind, but when they do get paged at 4:00 AM, they don't usually have to do anything very complicated. With Web-based applications, these two kinds of stress get combined. The programmers become system administrators, but without the sharply defined limits that ordinarily make the job bearable."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the shift from desktop to web-based software impact the roles of users and programmers in startups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shift from desktop to web-based software impacts the roles of users and programmers in startups significantly. Desktop software forces users to become system administrators, while web-based software shifts that responsibility to programmers. There is less stress in total, but more for the programmers. That's not necessarily bad news; if you're a startup competing with a big company, it's good news. Web-based applications offer a straightforward way to outwork your competitors. No startup asks for more."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What advantages do web applications offer despite their UI limitations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Web pages weren't designed to be a UI for applications, but they're just good enough. For a significant number of users, software that you can use from any browser will be enough of a win in itself to outweigh any awkwardness in the UI. Maybe you can't write the best-looking spreadsheet using HTML, but you can write a spreadsheet that several people can use simultaneously from different locations without special client software, or that can incorporate live data feeds, or that can page you when certain conditions are triggered. More importantly, you can write new kinds of applications that don't even have names yet. VisiCalc was not merely a microcomputer version of a mainframe application; after all, it was a new type of application."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of using web-based applications over server-based applications that rely on specific clients?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course, server-based applications don't have to be web-based. You could have some other kind of client. But I'm pretty sure that's a bad idea. It would be very convenient if you could assume that everyone would install your clientâso convenient that you could easily convince yourself that they all wouldâbut if they don't, you're hosed. Because web-based software assumes nothing about the client, it will work anywhere the web works. That's a big advantage already, and the advantage will grow as new web devices proliferate. Users will like you because your software just works, and your life will be easier because you won't have to tweak it for every new client."}]}

Convergence is probably coming, but where? I can't pick a winner. One thing I can predict is conflict between AOL and Microsoft. Whatever Microsoft's .NET turns out to be, it will probably involve connecting the desktop to servers. Unless AOL fights back, they will either be pushed aside or turned into a pipe between Microsoft client and server software. If Microsoft and AOL get into a client war, the only thing sure to work on both will be browsing the Web, meaning Web-based applications will be the only kind that work everywhere."}]}

You may not at first make more than you spend, but as long as the gap is closing fast enough, you'll be okay. If you start out underfunded, it will at least encourage a habit of frugality. The less you spend, the easier it is to make more than you spend. Fortunately, it can be very cheap to launch a Web-based application. We launched on under $10,000, and it would be even cheaper today. We had to spend thousands on a server and thousands more to get SSL. (The only company selling SSL software at the time was Netscape.) Now you can rent a much more powerful server, with SSL included, for less than we paid for bandwidth alone. You could launch a Web-based application now for less than the cost of a fancy office chair."}]}

You can do as much that Microsoft can't as they can do that you can't. And no one can stop you. You don't have to ask anyone's permission to develop Web-based applications. You don't have to do licensing deals, or get shelf space in retail stores, or grovel to have your application bundled with the OS.

Giving away the razor and making money on the blades may work for Gillette, but a razor is a much smaller commitment than a Web terminal. Cell phone handset makers are satisfied to sell hardware without trying to capture the service revenue as well. That should probably be the model for Internet clients too.

Given an initial critical mass and enough time, a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to be. Popularity further separates good languages from bad ones because feedback from real live users always leads to improvements. Look at how much any popular language has changed during its life.

Maybe for the first couple of hours. But a hacker can learn quickly enough that car means the first element of a list and cdr means the rest. Using first and rest means 50% more typing. They are also different lengths, meaning that the arguments won't line up when they're called, as car and cdr often are, in successive lines.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the implications of token length in programming languages like Perl and Common Lisp?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The individual tokens should be short as well. Perl and Common Lisp occupy opposite poles on this question. Perl programs can be almost cryptically dense, while the names of built-in Common Lisp operators are comically long. The designers of Common Lisp probably expected users to have text editors that would type these long names for them. However, the cost of a long name is not just the cost of typing it; there is also the cost of reading it and the cost of the space it takes up on your screen."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the main argument regarding programming language design in relation to user freedom and brevity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is one thing more important than brevity to a hacker: being able to do what you want. In the history of programming languages, a surprising amount of effort has gone into preventing programmers from doing things considered to be improper. This is a dangerously presumptuous plan. How can the language designer know what the programmer is going to need to do? I think language designers would do better to consider their target user to be a genius who will need to do things they never anticipated, rather than a bumbler who needs to be protected from himself. The bumbler will shoot himself in the foot anyway. You may save him from referring to variables in another package, but you can't save him from writing a badly designed program to solve the wrong problem and taking forever to do it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What motivates good programmers to engage in risky and unconventional coding practices?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good programmers often want to do dangerous and unsavory things. By \"unsavory,\" I mean things that go behind whatever semantic facade the language is trying to present: getting hold of the internal representation of some high-level abstraction, for example. Hackers like to hack, and hacking means getting inside things and second-guessing the original designer."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How should developers respond to unanticipated uses of programming languages by users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you make any tool, people use it in ways you didn't intend, and this is especially true of a highly articulated tool like a programming language. Many hackers will want to tweak your semantic model in a way that you never imagined. I say, let them; give the programmer access to as much internal stuff as you can without endangering runtime systems like the garbage collector."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Lisp's approach to macros reflect its historical flexibility for programmers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Historically, Lisp has been good at letting hackers have their way. The political correctness of Common Lisp is an aberration. Early Lisps let you get your hands on everything. A good deal of that spirit is, fortunately, preserved in macros.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics define a \"good\" programming language according to the author's perspective?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A really good language should be both clean and dirty: cleanly designed, with a small core of well-understood and highly orthogonal operators, but dirty in the sense that it lets hackers have their way with it. C is like this. So were the early Lisps. A real hacker's language will always have a slightly raffish character."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics make a programming language appealing to hackers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To be attractive to hackers, a language must be good for writing the kinds of programs they want to write.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a throwaway program and how can it unexpectedly develop into a permanent solution?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A throwaway program is a program you write quickly for some limited task: a program to automate some system administration task, generate test data for a simulation, or convert data from one format to another. The surprising thing about throwaway programs is that, like the \"temporary\" buildings built at so many American universities during World War II, they often don't get thrown away. Many evolve into real programs, with real features and real users."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential drawbacks of designing large projects from the outset?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have a hunch that the best big programs begin life this way, rather than being designed big from the start, like the Hoover Dam. It's terrifying to build something big from scratch. When people take on a project that's too big, they become overwhelmed. The project either gets bogged down, or the result is sterile and wooden: a shopping mall rather than a real downtown, BrasÃ­lia rather than Rome, Ada rather than C."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the significance of starting with throwaway programs in the development of large software systems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Starting with a throwaway program can significantly impact the development of large software systems. This approach is less daunting, and the design of the program benefits from evolution. If one looked closely, it would likely turn out that most large programs were developed this way. Those that evolved in this manner are probably still written in whatever language they were first created in, as it is rare for a program to be ported, except for political reasons. Paradoxically, if you want to create a language that is used for big systems, you must ensure it is suitable for writing throwaway programs, because that is where big systems originate."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did Perl evolve from a collection of utilities into a popular programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perl is a striking example of this idea. It was not only designed for writing throwaway programs, but was pretty much a throwaway program itself. Perl began life as a collection of utilities for generating reports and only evolved into a programming language as the throwaway programs people wrote in it grew larger. It was not until Perl 5 (if then) that the language was suitable for writing serious programs, and yet it was already massively popular."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics should a programming language have to be suitable for creating throwaway programs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What makes a language good for throwaway programs? To start with, it must be readily available. A throwaway program is something that you expect to write in an hour. So the language probably must already be installed on the computer you're using. It can't be something you have to install before you use it; it has to be there. C was there because it came with the operating system. Perl was there because it was originally a tool for system administrators, and yours had already installed it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What characteristics make a programming language more accessible and user-friendly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Being available means more than being installed, though. An interactive language with a command-line interface is more accessible than one that you have to compile and run separately. A popular programming language should be interactive and start up fast."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why are library functions considered important in programming, particularly in languages like Perl?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Library functions are considered important in programming, particularly in languages like Perl, because they allow programmers to utilize pre-written code, enhancing efficiency and brevity. Perl excels in this area due to its extensive libraries for manipulating strings. This class of library functions is especially crucial for throwaway programs, which are often initially created for tasks such as converting or extracting data. Many Perl programs likely begin as just a couple of library calls combined together."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What role will library functions play in the future of programming language design?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think a lot of the advances that happen in programming languages in the next fifty years will have to do with library functions. I believe future programming languages will have libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language. Programming language design will not be about whether to make your language strongly or weakly typed, or object-oriented, or functional, or whatever, but about how to design great libraries. The kind of language designers who like to think about how to design type systems may shudder at this. It's almost like writing applications! Too bad. Languages are for programmers, and libraries are what programmers need."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key considerations in designing effective programming libraries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Designing effective programming libraries is challenging. It's not simply a matter of writing a lot of code. Once the libraries get too big, it can sometimes take longer to find the function you need than to write the code yourself. Libraries need to be designed using a small set of orthogonal operators, just like the core language. It ought to be possible for the programmer to guess what library call will do what they need."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of Common Lisp regarding libraries and operating system interaction?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Libraries are one area where Common Lisp falls short. There are only rudimentary libraries for manipulating strings, and almost none for interacting with the operating system. For historical reasons, Common Lisp tries to pretend that the OS doesn't exist. Because you can't communicate with the OS, you're unlikely to be able to write a serious program using only the built-in operators in Common Lisp. You have to use some implementation-specific hacks as well, and in practice, these tend not to provide everything you want. Hackers would think a lot more highly of Lisp if Common Lisp had powerful string libraries and good OS support."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential issues with prefix notation in programming languages according to the paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two possible problems with prefix notation: that it is unfamiliar to programmers and that it is not dense enough. The conventional wisdom in the Lisp world is that the first problem is the real one. I'm not so sure. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary programmers panic. But I don't think ordinary programmers' opinions matter. Languages become popular or unpopular based on what expert hackers think of them, and I think expert hackers might be able to deal with prefix notation. Perl syntax can be pretty incomprehensible, but that has not stood in the way of Perl's popularity. If anything, it may have helped foster a Perl cult."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do some programmers prefer infix notation over prefix notation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A more serious problem is the diffuseness of prefix notation. For expert hackers, that really is a problem. No one wants to write (aref a x y) when they could write a[x, y]."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What technique can be used to simplify expressions involving data structures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this particular case, there is a way to finesse our way out of the problem. If we treat data structures as if they were functions on indexes, we could write (a x y) instead, which is even shorter than the Perl form. Similar tricks may shorten other types of expressions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can treating indentation as significant improve code readability and reduce bugs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Treating indentation as significant can improve code readability and reduce bugs by eliminating the need for excessive parentheses. This approach aligns with how programmers naturally read code; when indentation indicates one meaning and delimiters suggest another, programmers tend to prioritize the indentation. By making indentation significant, we can eliminate this common source of bugs and create shorter, more readable programs."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might infix syntax be preferred over prefix syntax in programming, particularly for mathematical expressions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Infix syntax is sometimes easier to read, especially for mathematical expressions. I have used Lisp my whole programming life, and I still don't find prefix math expressions natural. However, it is convenient, especially when generating code, to have operators that take any number of arguments. Therefore, if we do have infix syntax, it should probably be implemented as some kind of read-macro."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the author's perspective on the introduction of additional syntax in Lisp?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't think we should be religiously opposed to introducing syntax into Lisp, as long as it translates in a well-understood way into underlying s-expressions. There is already a good deal of syntax in Lisp. It's not necessarily bad to introduce more, as long as no one is forced to use it. In Common Lisp, some delimiters are reserved for the language, suggesting that at least some of the designers intended to have more syntax in the future."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the limitations of format strings in Common Lisp regarding syntax integration?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the most egregiously unlispy pieces of syntax in Common Lisp occurs in format strings; format is a language in its own right, and that language is not Lisp. If there were a plan for introducing more syntax into Lisp, format specifiers might be able to be included in it. It would be a good thing if macros could generate format specifiers the way they generate any other kind of code."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the frequent reference to the section on format in CLTL suggest about Lisp programming practices?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An eminent Lisp hacker told me that his copy of CLTL falls open to the section on format. Mine too. This probably indicates room for improvement. It may also mean that programs do a lot of I/O."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the most effective approach to optimizing code performance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To optimize code performance effectively, it is essential to use a very good profiler rather than relying solely on making the language strongly typed. You do not need to know the type of every argument in every call throughout the program. However, you do need to be able to declare the types of arguments in the bottlenecks. More importantly, you must be able to identify where the bottlenecks are."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a common criticism of Lisp regarding performance, and how can it be addressed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it's hard to tell what's expensive. This might be true. It might also be inevitable if you want to have a very abstract language. In any case, I think good profiling would go a long way toward fixing the problem: you'd soon learn what was expensive."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the relationship between compiler speed and the effectiveness of profiling tools in programming languages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Part of the problem here is social. Language designers like to write fast compilers; that's how they measure their skill. They think of the profiler as an add-on, at best. But in practice, a good profiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written in the language than a compiler that generates fast code. Here, again, language designers are somewhat out of touch with their users. They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrong problem."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can an active profiler improve a programmer's ability to identify performance issues in their code?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An active profiler can significantly enhance a programmer's ability to identify performance issues in their code by proactively providing performance data instead of waiting for the programmer to request it. For example, the profiler could highlight bottlenecks in red as the programmer edits the source code. Another approach would be to visually represent what is happening in running programs. This would be particularly beneficial in server-based applications, where multiple programs are running simultaneously. An active profiler could graphically display memory usage as a program runs or even produce sounds that indicate what is occurring."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can sound serve as an indicator of server issues in a monitoring system?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sound is a good cue to problems. In one place I worked, we had a big board of dials showing what was happening to our web servers. The hands were moved by little servomotors that made a slight noise when they turned. I couldn't see the board from my desk, but I found that I could tell immediately, by the sound, when there was a problem with a server."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the potential advantages of incorporating byte code as an official feature in Lisps?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A number of Lisps now compile into byte code, which is then executed by an interpreter. This is usually done to make the implementation easier to port, but it could be a useful language feature. It might be a good idea to make the byte code an official part of the language and to allow programmers to use inline byte code in bottlenecks. Then, such optimizations would be portable too."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the number of simultaneous users per processor a critical factor for server-based applications?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Users are interested in response time. But another kind of efficiency will be increasingly important: the number of simultaneous users you can support per processor. Many of the interesting applications written in the near future will be server-based, and the number of users per server is the critical question for anyone hosting such applications. In the capital cost of a business offering a server-based application, this is the divisor."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors should be considered when optimizing performance for applications with multiple users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In some applications, the processor will be the limiting factor, and execution speed will be the most important thing to optimize. However, often memory will be the limit; the number of simultaneous users will be determined by the amount of memory needed for each user's data. The programming language can help here too. Good support for threads will enable all the users to share a single heap. It may also help to have persistent objects and/or language-level support for lazy loading."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factor contributes significantly to the popularity and adoption of a programming language among developers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The last ingredient a popular language needs is time. No one wants to write programs in a language that might go away, as so many programming languages do. So, most hackers will tend to wait until a language has been around for a couple of years before even considering using it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might an inventor hesitate to act on requests immediately?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Inventors of wonderful new things are often surprised to discover this: you need time to get any message through to people. A friend of mine rarely does anything the first time someone asks him. He knows that people sometimes ask for things that they turn out not to want. To avoid wasting his time, he waits until the third or fourth time he's asked to do something; by then, whoever's asking him may be fairly annoyed, but at least they probably really do want whatever they're asking for."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why might individuals choose to delay their engagement with new technologies or trends?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most people have learned to do a similar sort of filtering on new things they hear about. They don't even start paying attention until they've heard about something ten times. They're perfectly justified: the majority of hot new trends do turn out to be a waste of time and eventually go away. By delaying learning VRML, I avoided having to learn it at all."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges do inventors face in getting their innovative ideas accepted by the public?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Anyone who invents something new has to expect to keep repeating their message for years before people will start to get it.

It wasn't that they were stupid; they just had us tuned out."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can persistence in sharing your story lead to greater visibility and attention from others?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The good news is that simple repetition solves the problem.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is it beneficial for new technologies to be initially adopted by a small group of early users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Itâs just as well that it usually takes a while to gain momentum. Most technologies evolve a good deal even after theyâre first launched â programming languages especially. Nothing could be better for a new technology than a few years of being used only by a small number of early adopters. Early adopters are sophisticated and demanding, and quickly flush out whatever flaws remain in your technology. When you only have a few users, you can be in close contact with all of them. And early adopters are forgiving when you improve your system, even if this causes some breakage."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the organic growth method of introducing new technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are two ways new technology gets introduced: the organic growth method and the big bang method. The organic growth method is exemplified by the classic seat-of-the-pants, underfunded garage startup. A couple of guys, working in obscurity, develop some new technology. They launch it with no marketing and initially have only a few (fanatically devoted) users. They continue to improve the technology, and meanwhile, their user base grows by word of mouth. Before they know it, they're big."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the big bang method in the context of startup development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The big bang method, in the context of startup development, is exemplified by the VC-backed, heavily marketed startup.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of organic growth compared to the big bang approach in technology development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Generally, the garage guys envy the big bang guys. The big bang guys are smooth, confident, and respected by the VCs. They can afford the best of everything, and the PR campaign surrounding the launch has the side effect of making them celebrities. The organic growth guys, sitting in their garage, feel poor and unloved. And yet, I think they are often mistaken to feel sorry for themselves. Organic growth seems to yield better technology and richer founders than the big bang method. If you look at the dominant technologies today, you'll find that most of them grew organically."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How can the use of big abstractions in programming facilitate rapid development and subsequent optimization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Using big abstractions, you can write the first version of a program very quickly. Later, when you want to optimize, there's a really good profiler that tells you where to focus your attention. You can make inner loops blindingly fast, even writing inline bytecode if you need to."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How user-friendly is the language for beginners in terms of learning resources?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are lots of good examples to learn from, and the language is intuitive enough that you can learn how to use it from examples in a couple of minutes. You don't need to look in the manual much. The manual is thin and has few warnings and qualifications."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the key features of the programming language's design and its libraries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The language has a small core and powerful, highly orthogonal libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language. The libraries all work well together; everything in the language fits together like the parts in a fine camera. Nothing is deprecated or retained for compatibility. The source code of all the libraries is readily available. It's easy to talk to the operating system and to applications written in other languages."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How is the structure of the language organized in terms of abstractions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The language is built in layers. The higher-level abstractions are built in a very transparent way out of lower-level abstractions, which you can access if you want."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the principles of flexibility and participation in the design of the programming language described?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nothing is hidden from you that doesn't absolutely have to be. The language offers abstractions only as a way of saving you work, rather than as a way of telling you what to do. In fact, the language encourages you to be an equal participant in its design. You can change everything about it, including even its syntax, and anything you write has, as much as possible, the same status as what comes predefined."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges did Hart identify in Lisp 1.5 regarding variable handling?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hart, in 1964, identified challenges in Lisp 1.5 regarding variable handling. What was missing, initially, were ways to avoid variable capture and multiple evaluation; Hart's examples are subject to both."}]}

That's the trouble with fleas; they only like the bizarre stuff. They hate their bread-and-butter cases. That's the difference between us and the fucking fleas. See, we love big juicy lumbar disc herniations, but they hate hypertension....\""}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What prompted the writing of this essay on Java?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This essay developed out of conversations I've had with several other programmers about why Java seemed suspicious. It's not a critique of Java! It is a case study of hackers' radar."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How did the meaning of the phrase \"you can't tell a book by its cover\" evolve with changes in book publishing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The aphorism \"you can't tell a book by its cover\" originated in times when books were sold in plain cardboard covers, to be bound by each purchaser according to his own taste. In those days, you couldn't tell a book by its cover. However, publishing has advanced since then: present-day publishers work hard to make the cover something you can tell a book by."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What insights has the author gained from their experiences in bookshops and with technology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I spend a lot of time in bookshops, and I feel as if I have by now learned to understand everything publishers mean to tell me about a book, and perhaps a bit more. The time I haven't spent in bookshops, I've spent mostly in front of computers, and I feel as if I've learned, to some degree, to judge technology by its cover as well. It may be just luck, but I've saved myself from a few technologies that turned out to be real stinkers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the author's initial impressions and concerns about the Java programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So far, Java seems like a stinker to me. I've never written a Java program, never more than glanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won't be a very successful language. I may turn out to be mistaken; making predictions about technology is a dangerous business. But for what it's worth, as a sort of time capsule, here's why I don't like the look of Java:"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What distinguishes a genuine standard from a promoted technology in the programming community?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A genuine standard is distinguished from a promoted technology by the level of hype surrounding it. Real standards don't have to be promoted; no one had to promote C, Unix, or HTML. A real standard tends to be already established by the time most people hear about it. On the hacker radar screen, Perl is as big as Java, or bigger, just on the strength of its own merits."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do many developers feel compelled to use Java instead of choosing it willingly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Many developers feel compelled to use Java instead of choosing it willingly because they are often forced to do so. A lot of the people I know using Java are doing it because they feel they have to. Either it's something they felt they had to do to get funded, or something they thought customers would want, or something they were told to do by management. These are smart people; if the technology was good, they'd have used it voluntarily."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some criticisms of Java as a programming language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Java can be criticized for being bureaucratic. From what little I know about Java, there seem to be a lot of protocols for doing things. Really good languages aren't like that; they let you do what you want and get out of the way."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What factors differentiate programming languages preferred by large organizations from those favored by hackers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Large organizations have different aims from hackers. They want languages that are believed to be suitable for use by large teams of mediocre programmersâlanguages with features that, like the speed limiters in U-Haul trucks, prevent fools from doing too much damage. Hackers don't like a language that talks down to them; they just want power. Historically, languages designed for large organizations (PL/I, Ada) have lost, while hacker languages (C, Perl) have won. The reason: today's teenage hacker is tomorrow's CTO."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who tends to favor Java according to the author's perspective?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The wrong people like it. The programmers I admire most are not, on the whole, captivated by Java. Who does like Java? Suits, who don't know one language from another but know that they keep hearing about Java in the press; programmers at big companies, who are amazed to find that there is something even better than C++; and plug-and-chug undergrads, who are ready to like anything that might get them a job (will this be on the test?). These people's opinions change with every wind."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What challenges is Sun facing that could impact its future and the viability of Java?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sun's business model is being undermined on two fronts. Cheap Intel processors, of the same type used in desktop machines, are now more than fast enough for servers. Additionally, FreeBSD seems to be at least as good an OS for servers as Solaris. Sun's advertising implies that you need Sun servers for industrial-strength applications. If this were true, Yahoo would be first in line to buy Suns; however, when I worked there, the servers were all Intel boxes running FreeBSD. This bodes ill for Sun's future. If Sun runs into trouble, they could drag Java down with them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does the Defense Department's preference for Java suggest about its approach to software development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Defense Department's preference for Java suggests a cautious and procedural approach to software development. The DoD encourages developers to use Java, which may indicate a reliance on established, traditional programming languages rather than embracing more innovative or flexible options. While the Defense Department does a fine (though expensive) job of defending the country, their culture is heavily focused on plans, procedures, and protocols. This approach contrasts sharply with hacker culture, which values experimentation and agility. Historically, when the DoD has favored a programming language, such as Ada, it has often led to less favorable outcomes in software development."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the author's thoughts on the potential quality of Java as a programming language despite its corporate backing and mainstream promotion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It could be that in Java's case I'm mistaken. It could be that a language promoted by one big company to undermine another, designed by a committee for a \"mainstream\" audience, hyped to the skies, and beloved of the DoD, happens nonetheless to be a clean, beautiful, powerful language that I would love programming in. It could be, but it seems very unlikely."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the portrayal of the justice system on television differ from its reality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The real world does not work like the version I was shown on TV growing up. The police often arrest the wrong person. Defendants' lawyers are often incompetent, and prosecutors are often motivated more by publicity than justice."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the main ethical concern surrounding the death penalty?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The main ethical concern surrounding the death penalty is that some people sentenced to death are innocent. So this is not about whether it's okay to kill killers; this is about whether it's okay to kill innocent people."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should California voters consider regarding Proposition 62 and Proposition 66?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This year, in California, you have a chance to end this by voting yes on Proposition 62. But beware, because there is another proposition, Proposition 66, whose goal is to make it easier to execute people. So yes on 62, no on 66."}]}
