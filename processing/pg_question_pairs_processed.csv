"Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. ""You get out,"" I heard a thousand times, ""what you put in."" They meant well, but this is rarely true.

"It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true.

They prefer walking, bicycling, or taking public transport. If you've been to San Francisco recently, you can't help but notice the huge number of bicyclists.

This technique is successful (in the long term) because it gives you all the advantages other people forgo by trying to seem legit.  If you work on overlooked problems, you're more likely to discover new things, because you have less competition.  If you deliver solutions informally, you (a) save all the effort you would have had to expend to make them look impressive, and (b) avoid the danger of fooling yourself as well as your audience.  And if you release a crude version 1 then iterate, your solution can benefit from the imagination of nature, which, as Feynman pointed out, is more powerful than your own.",What are the benefits of using contrarian investment strategies and addressing overlooked problems in order to foster innovation?,"Contrarian investment strategies are beneficial because they provide advantages that others forgo in their pursuit of legitimacy.

"So far, Java seems like a stinker to me.  I've never written a Java program, never more than glanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won't be a very successful language. I may turn out to be mistaken; making predictions about technology is a dangerous business.  But for what it's worth, as a sort of time capsule, here's why I don't like the look of Java:",What are the author's initial impressions and concerns about the Java programming language?,"So far, Java seems like a stinker to me.

"1. It has been so energetically hyped.  Real standards don't have to be promoted.  No one had to promote C, or Unix, or HTML.

"2. It's aimed low.  In the original Java white paper, Gosling explicitly says Java was designed not to be too difficult for programmers used to C.  It was designed to be another C++: C plus a few ideas taken from more advanced languages.  Like the creators of sitcoms or junk food or package tours, Java's designers were consciously designing a product for people not as smart as them. Historically, languages designed for other people to use have been bad:  Cobol, PL/I, Pascal, Ada, C++.

"3. It has ulterior motives.  Someone once said that the world would be a better place if people only wrote books because they had something to say, rather than because they wanted to write a book.

"5. People are forced to use it.  A lot of the people I know using Java are using it because they feel they have to.

"8. It's pseudo-hip.  Sun now pretends that Java is a grassroots, open-source language effort like Perl or Python.  This one just happens to be controlled by a giant company.

"9. It's designed for large organizations.  Large organizations have different aims from hackers.

"12. The DoD likes it.  The Defense Department is encouraging developers to use Java. This seems to me the most damning sign of all.  The Defense Department does a fine (though expensive) job of defending the country, but they love plans and procedures and protocols.  Their culture is the opposite of hacker culture; on questions of software they will tend to bet wrong.  The last time the DoD really liked a programming language, it was Ada.",What does the Defense Department's preference for Java suggest about its approach to software development?,"The Defense Department's preference for Java suggests a cautious and procedural approach to software development. The DoD encourages developers to use Java, which may indicate a reliance on established, traditional programming languages rather than embracing more innovative or flexible options. While the Defense Department does a fine (though expensive) job of defending the country, their culture is heavily focused on plans, procedures, and protocols. This approach contrasts sharply with hacker culture, which values experimentation and agility. Historically, when the DoD has favored a programming language, such as Ada, it has often led to less favorable outcomes in software development.",YES
